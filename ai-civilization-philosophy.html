    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <h2>1. Technology changed too fast, and our worldview stayed too old</h2>
    <p>
        AI is not a technology that merely changes human life.  
        It is a technology that forces us to question what it means to be human.
    </p>
    <p>
        AI does not understand knowledge—  
        yet it handles knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
        It has no consciousness—  
        yet it judges.
    </p>
    <p>
        It has no intention—  
        yet it produces consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
        And before this non-human intelligence,  
        we face, for the first time, the question:
        <strong>“By what standard should we live?”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Whenever civilization trembled, humanity rewrote its worldview.  
        Now is exactly such a moment.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Philosophy has become essential in our time</h2>
    <p>
        People often ask:
        <br>Will AI replace our jobs?
        <br>Will humans become worthless?
        <br>Will democracy survive?
        <br>Will labor disappear?
    </p>
    <p>
        But there is a far larger question:
        <strong>“In the age of AI, what principles should the world operate by?”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Civilization is not sustained by technology.  
        It is governed by worldviews.
    </p>
    <p>
        Plato, in an age of chaos,  
        established an entire worldview as a single coherent system—  
        a foundation that shaped civilization for 2,400 years.
    </p>
    <p>
        We now live in a similar era:  
        an <em>interregnum of worldview</em>.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Why Plato again?</h2>
    <p>
        The reason to summon Plato is simple.  
        Not because he was a “philosopher,”  
        but because he was the last thinker  
        who bound an entire civilization into one integrated framework of thought.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since then, philosophy fragmented.  
        Economics, politics, and ethics diverged.  
        Civilization scattered into pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
        But the moment AI appeared,  
        humanity was forced to see the whole again:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What is the human being? (Ontology)</li>
        <li>What do we know? (Epistemology)</li>
        <li>What is right? (Ethics)</li>
        <li>How should society function? (Political philosophy)</li>
        <li>How is value created? (Economic philosophy)</li>
        <li>What is human nature? (Education & cultural philosophy)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        AI disrupts all of these fields at once.  
        Therefore, like Plato, we must recover a form of “thinking as a whole.”
    </p>

    <h2>4. This is not an “AI guidebook”</h2>
    <p>
        This trilogy is not a technical manual,  
        nor a future-trend report,  
        nor a critique of AI.
    </p>
    <p>
        What this work attempts is far more fundamental:  
        <strong>to redesign the worldview by which civilization should operate in the age of AI.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Part I examines the need for worldviews  
        and the collapse of human-centered philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Part II reinterprets the giants of ancient and modern thought  
        through the lens of the AI era, laying a new foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Part III finally attempts to construct  
        a new worldview for the post-Plato age.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Why this series is necessary</h2>
    <p>
        Today, amid the runaway acceleration of technology,  
        we are losing our sense of:
        <br>what we believe,  
        <br>what we aim for,  
        <br>and what we must protect.
    </p>
    <p>
        The world asks:
        <strong>“Will AI take our jobs?”</strong>
        <br>Yet the deeper question is:
        <strong>“How will our meaning change?”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The world asks:
        <strong>“If AI makes a wrong judgment, who is responsible?”</strong>
        <br>But the deeper question is:
        <strong>“How must the very concept of responsibility be redefined?”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The world asks:
        <strong>“If AI handles knowledge, what is left for humans to do?”</strong>
        <br>But the fundamental question is:
        <strong>“What is knowledge?”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        This series reconstructs these foundational questions  
        into a single philosophical system.
    </p>
    <p>
        In other words, this is not a book that explains the anxieties of an era—  
        it is a book that designs the civilization to come.
    </p>

    <h2>6. And finally…</h2>
    <p>
        Who will succeed Plato?  
        This question began the series.
    </p>
    <p>
        And after 27 chapters, we return to it again.
    </p>
    <p>
        The one who succeeds Plato  
        is not necessarily a scholar or an elite,  
        nor someone who masters both philosophy and technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        The one who succeeds Plato  
        is the human being who asks  
        about the structure of a new civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have read this work to the end,  
        then you are already the one  
        who has asked that question,  
        borne that question,  
        and chosen to carry it together.
    </p>

    <h2>Final Sentence of the Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The worldview of the AI age is not a world created by someone else for us to accept—  
        it is a world we must recreate together.
    </p>
    <p>
        These 27 chapters are the first step toward that reconstruction.

    <h1>Episode 1. Why Return to Plato Now?</h1>
    <h2>From <em>Finding a New Plato in the Age of AI</em> — Season 1, Episode 1</h2>

    <h3>Prologue — Why a Philosopher from 2,400 Years Ago Is Being Summoned Again</h3>
    <p>
        For the first time in human history, we have entered an age in which we live
        alongside <strong>non-human intelligence—Artificial Intelligence</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This new intelligence handles more knowledge than humans, learns faster than humans,
        and thinks in ways fundamentally different from humans.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is not a technological shift.  
        It is an event that shakes the very skeleton of civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
        And to understand this immense transformation,  
        we are, surprisingly, forced to return to <strong>Plato</strong>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Why?</strong></p>

    <h3>1. Plato designed the “operating system (OS)” of Western civilization</h3>
    <p>
        Plato was not merely an ancient philosopher.
        He unified almost every domain that structures the human world—
        knowledge, truth, morality, politics, society, education—
        into a single philosophical framework.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the basis of human reason, he created a civilizational manual:
        <em>“This is how the world works.”</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        And that manual functioned as the standard framework of civilization
        for 2,400 years.
    </p>
    <p>
        The structure of science,  
        the criteria of ethics,  
        the concept of politics,  
        the purpose of education—  
        all evolved within a Platonic framework.
    </p>

    <h3>2. But AI is shaking this Platonic framework directly</h3>
    <p>
        The core of Plato’s worldview is simple:
        <strong>“Human reason is the center that understands and governs the world.”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        But AI now thinks faster and deeper than humans,
        and even the production of knowledge is increasingly performed
        more efficiently by AI.
    </p>
    <p>
        This means that:
        <br>the production of truth,  
        <br>the structure of knowledge,  
        <br>social judgment,  
        <br>political decision-making,  
        <br>ethical standards—  
        all of these are beginning to move away from human centrality.
    </p>
    <p>
        The most fundamental premise of the Platonic worldview  
        is beginning to collapse.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Therefore, we have no choice but to return to Plato</h3>
    <p>
        This paradox matters.
    </p>
    <p>
        Precisely because Plato’s framework is collapsing,  
        we must understand why his framework was so powerful—  
        and what kind of new framework could replace it.
    </p>
    <p>
        In other words:  
        <strong>Plato is collapsing, and therefore we must read Plato again.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We are not trying to imitate Plato,  
        but to recover the kind of thinking he practiced—  
        a way of viewing civilization as an integrated whole.
    </p>

    <h3>4. The age of AI cannot be explained by partial discourse</h3>
    <p>
        Today the world is flooded with isolated AI topics:
        <br>AI ethics  
        <br>AI and jobs  
        <br>AI in politics  
        <br>AI risk (AGI risk)  
        <br>AI economics  
        <br>AI education  
    </p>
    <p>
        But these issues do not move independently.  
        They are all connected at a deep level through a single transformation
        of the worldview.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fixing one or two issues will not yield answers.  
        We must see the whole again.  
        We need Platonic, integrated thinking.
    </p>

    <h3>5. We are now in the fourth civilizational “great shift of thought”</h3>
    <p>
        Humanity has experienced only three eras in which  
        the entire worldview was rewritten:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The age of Plato, Confucius, and the Buddha — the birth of thought</li>
        <li>The transition from medieval to modern (Descartes, Kant) — the establishment of human reason</li>
        <li>Nietzsche and the modern deconstruction era — the collapse of existing values</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        And now, the fourth shift is coming:
        <br>the age in which AI surpasses the human-centered worldview.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is a time when the entire structure of civilization must be rebuilt.
        In such an era, Platonic thinking—  
        the design of an entire worldview—  
        is summoned again.
    </p>

    <h3>6. And thus, the conclusion of Episode 1 is simple</h3>
    <p>
        We are not returning to Plato because we need him.  
        We are returning to Plato because we need a worldview  
        that goes <em>beyond</em> Plato.
    </p>
    <p>
        The age of AI cannot be understood without addressing:
        <br>philosophy,  
        <br>technology,  
        <br>politics,  
        <br>economics,  
        <br>society,  
        <br>ontology—  
        all at once.
    </p>
    <p>
        The message of Episode 1 is simple yet powerful:
        <br><strong>“In an era where Plato’s worldview is shaking,  
        we must begin again with Plato.”</strong>

    <h1>Episode 2. Socrates, Confucius, Buddha, and Plato — The Archetypes of Worldviews</h1>
    <h2>From <em>Finding a New Plato in the Age of AI</em> — Season 1, Episode 2</h2>

    <h3>Prologue — The Age of AI Summons the “Original Forms of Thought”</h3>
    <p>
        To design a worldview for the age of AI,  
        we must first look back at the “starting points of thought.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Philosophy is never created from nothing.  
        It is added onto foundations that already exist.
    </p>
    <p>
        The mindset of the civilization we live in today rests upon four pillars:
        <br>Socrates’ inquiry,  
        <br>Confucius’ social ethics,  
        <br>Buddha’s philosophy of consciousness,  
        <br>Plato’s metaphysics.
    </p>
    <p>
        What AI disrupts is not merely technological order,  
        but the deep foundations of these four archetypes.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is why we must read these archetypes again.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Socrates — A worldview built on “the questioning human”</h3>
    <p>
        Socrates was not the man who answered questions—  
        he was the one who invented the act of questioning itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        His central principle can be summarized in a single sentence:
        <strong>“Know thyself.”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        This was not a slogan for self-help.  
        It was a declaration that <em>truth is revealed through dialogue</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Humans learn through questioning.  
        Truth becomes refined through argument and discussion.  
        Knowledge is created not through authority, but through verification.
    </p>
    <p>
        Yet in the age of AI, answers are everywhere—  
        and the questioning human is beginning to disappear.
    </p>
    <p>
        When AI provides every answer,  
        the ability to ask questions becomes humanity’s essential competency.
    </p>
    <p>
        And so, in the age of AI, Socrates becomes important again.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Confucius — A worldview of “a world made of relationships”</h3>
    <p>
        Confucius differs from the Western, individual-centered tradition.  
        He saw the world as built out of <strong>relationships</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Humans do not exist alone—they exist within networks:
        <br><strong>Filial piety</strong> → family and kinship  
        <br><strong>Ritual propriety</strong> → social harmony  
        <br><strong>Benevolence</strong> → communal care
    </p>
    <p>
        In Confucius’ worldview,  
        “the stability of relationships” is equal to “the stability of civilization.”
    </p>
    <p>
        The age of AI shakes this archetype in new ways:
        <br>AI assistants and algorithmic recommendations,  
        <br>automated interaction patterns,  
        <br>weakening of social cohesion through SNS,  
        <br>the disintegration of community,  
        <br>the isolation of individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
        Confucius raises the question:  
        <strong>What kind of order is possible when human–human relationships  
        expand into human–AI relationships?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        In the age of AI, Confucius becomes a crucial guide  
        for redesigning relationships and communities.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Buddha — The philosophy of “consciousness and suffering”</h3>
    <p>
        Buddha had only one question:
        <strong>“Why do humans suffer?”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        His analysis is strikingly modern:
        <br>The human self is not a substance but a construction.  
        <br>Desire and attachment produce suffering.  
        <br>Consciousness is constantly changing.  
        <br>The sense of “I” is nothing more than a shifting stream.
    </p>
    <p>
        Surprisingly, the age of AI resurrects Buddha’s perspective with force.
    </p>
    <p>
        AI generates intelligence without consciousness:
        <br>Learning without awareness,  
        <br>Goals without desire,  
        <br>Self-correction without a self.
    </p>
    <p>
        AI presents an entirely new form of being—  
        <strong>“intelligence without suffering.”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Buddha’s thought now asks:
        <strong>In an era of consciousness-free intelligence,  
        what kind of being is the human?</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>4. Plato — The “civilization architect” who unified the entire world</h3>
    <p>
        Plato differs from Socrates, Confucius, and Buddha.
    </p>
    <p>
        They sought to understand humans and society;  
        Plato sought to design the entire structure of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        His architecture included:
        <br><strong>Truth</strong> (the Forms),  
        <br><strong>Knowledge</strong> (the philosopher),  
        <br><strong>Society</strong> (the just state),  
        <br><strong>The human</strong> (reason, spirit, desire),  
        <br><strong>Education</strong> (political and moral cultivation).
    </p>
    <p>
        He was not merely a philosopher.  
        He was a designer of civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
        For this reason, Plato becomes the starting point  
        for a “new worldview” in the age of AI.
    </p>
    <p>
        His framework assumes:
        <br>human centrality,  
        <br>reason as the guiding force,  
        <br>the fixity of truth.
    </p>
    <p>
        The age of AI disrupts these assumptions:
        <br>AI’s non-rational, non-conscious intelligence,  
        <br>pattern recognition beyond human ability,  
        <br>the collapse of fixed truth (data-driven fluidity).
    </p>
    <p>
        Understanding Plato is the foundational step  
        for answering the question:
        <br><strong>“What must now be replaced?”</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>5. The “civilizational structure” shaped by the four thinkers is dissolving in the age of AI</h3>
    <p>In brief:</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Thinker</th>
                <th>Mode of Understanding</th>
                <th>Impact of the AI Era</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Socrates</td>
                <td>Questions & Dialogue</td>
                <td>Decline in the value of questioning; excess of answers</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Confucius</td>
                <td>Relationships & Community</td>
                <td>Algorithmic society; restructuring of human relationships</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Buddha</td>
                <td>Consciousness & Self</td>
                <td>The rise of consciousness-free intelligence</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Plato</td>
                <td>The structure of the entire world</td>
                <td>The collapse of human-centered frameworks</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
        These four worldviews are now shaking simultaneously.  
        Therefore, we must reinterpret each archetype  
        and construct a new framework.
    </p>
    <p>
        The worldview of the AI age  
        will be rebuilt upon these four foundations.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Conclusion of Episode 2 — It is time to reopen the “original files of the worldview”</h3>
    <p>
        The central message of Episode 2 is simple:
    </p>
    <p>
        To understand the age of AI,  
        we must reopen the archetypes of human thought.
    </p>
    <p>
        What AI shakes is not individual technologies or industries,  
        but <strong>the very way humans have understood the world</strong>.

    <h1>Episode 3. How Plato’s Worldview Dominated 2,400 Years</h1>
    <h2>From <em>Finding a New Plato in the Age of AI</em> — Season 1, Episode 3</h2>

    <h3>Prologue — “An ancient future” still forms our skeleton</h3>
    <p>
        The thoughts, values, institutions, and structures of knowledge in our age  
        remain astonishingly bound to Plato’s influence.
    </p>
    <p>
        Think about it:
        <br>the way universities teach philosophy, science, and ethics,  
        <br>the political systems of states,  
        <br>our societal concept of justice,  
        <br>the modern faith in human rationality,  
        <br>the structure of truth and knowledge,  
        <br>the very idea of leaders and expert classes—  
        all of these have operated on the basis of Plato’s worldview.
    </p>
    <p>
        The basic mental framework we take for granted today  
        is not modern thinking at all—  
        it is largely an upgraded version of Platonic architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
        But in the age of AI, this structure is facing its first major fracture.
    </p>
    <p>
        And so we must first understand  
        why Plato’s worldview survived for so long.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Plato was the first to see the “entire world” as a single blueprint</h3>
    <p>
        Other thinkers saw only parts:
        <br>Socrates: inquiry  
        <br>Confucius: relationships  
        <br>Buddha: consciousness  
        <br>Aristotle: classification and knowledge
    </p>
    <p>
        But Plato was bold:
        <br><strong>“Human beings, society, truth, the world… these are all part of one structure.”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        He attempted—for the first time in human history—  
        to integrate the entirety of civilization into a single theory.
    </p>
    <p>
        Under his hand, the word “philosophy” became  
        a form of <strong>civilizational design</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This architectural mode of thinking is why  
        his framework became the foundation of civilization for 2,400 years.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Plato’s world is structured as a hierarchy</h3>
    <p>
        Plato did not see the world as simple.  
        He structured all existence as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Highest:</strong> the Forms (the realm of unchanging truth)</li>
        <li><strong>Middle:</strong> mind and reason (the human ability to grasp truth)</li>
        <li><strong>Lowest:</strong> senses and matter (the imperfect, changing world)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This structure seems simple,  
        but it became the skeleton for academic, political, educational,  
        and social systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even today:
        <br>Science seeks the “laws behind appearances” (Forms),  
        <br>law and politics seek “universal principles,”  
        <br>education emphasizes “ascending from ignorance to truth.”
    </p>
    <p>
        All of these arise from Plato’s structural worldview.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Plato defined humans as “rational beings”</h3>
    <p>
        This assumption seems so obvious that people overlook its significance—  
        but in worldview design, it is one of the most powerful decisions ever made.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>“Reason is the unique privilege of humans,  
        and reason makes humans the masters of the world.”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        This idea became the foundation for politics, law, ethics, society,  
        and philosophy itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        In short, Plato is the creator  
        of the <strong>human-centered worldview</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        And it is this structure  
        that the age of AI is challenging for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because now, beings exist  
        with <strong>high intelligence without reason</strong>—AI.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Plato invented the “knowledge-producing class”</h3>
    <p>
        The state Plato designed consisted of three types of people:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Philosophers:</strong> seekers of truth, designers of the world</li>
        <li><strong>Guardians:</strong> maintainers of order</li>
        <li><strong>Producers:</strong> ordinary citizens</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This structure still repeats in modern society:
        <br>professors and researchers (philosophers),  
        <br>administrators and bureaucrats (guardians),  
        <br>workers and citizens (producers).
    </p>
    <p>
        The modern university–government–industry system  
        largely inherits Plato’s division of labor.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even the distinction between  
        “those who create knowledge” and “those who use knowledge”  
        originates from Plato.
    </p>
    <p>
        But AI is dismantling this structure entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
        AI now:
        <br>produces knowledge,  
        <br>makes judgments,  
        <br>manages systems,  
        <br>and executes actions.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have entered the moment  
        when the Platonic knowledge hierarchy collapses technologically.
    </p>

    <h3>5. The real reason Plato’s worldview was so strong: its “completeness”</h3>
    <p>
        Plato was not just a deep thinker.  
        He offered a complete operating manual for the world:
    </p>
    <p>
        Why do humans behave as they do?  
        How should society be built?  
        What qualities should a political leader have?  
        Why is education necessary?  
        How can we know truth?
    </p>
    <p>
        Plato gave <strong>one unified answer</strong> to all these questions.
    </p>
    <p>
        This unity is why his worldview survived for 2,400 years.
    </p>

    <h3>6. The end of the Platonic worldview: the arrival of AI</h3>
    <p>
        Plato’s worldview dominated for far too long.  
        But now its foundation is collapsing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Plato saw human reason and the philosopher  
        as the center of the world and the peak of governance.
    </p>
    <p>
        But the age of AI asks:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Is reason the only standard for intelligence?</strong><br>→ AI thinks without reason.</li>
        <li><strong>Is truth fixed?</strong><br>→ Data-driven models continually update.</li>
        <li><strong>Is knowledge the monopoly of expert classes?</strong><br>→ AI generates knowledge autonomously.</li>
        <li><strong>Must leaders be human?</strong><br>→ AI-assisted decision systems already exist.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The Platonic worldview is being questioned at its roots.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Conclusion of Episode 3 — Plato’s strength was his ability to bind “the whole”</h3>
    <p>
        The essence of Episode 3 is this:
    </p>
    <p>
        Plato was the first to unify truth, society, politics, education,  
        and human nature into one integrated worldview.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is why he became the skeleton of civilization for 2,400 years.
    </p>
    <p>
        But AI is beginning to dismantle that skeleton entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, we are not trying to destroy Plato—  
        but rather to answer three questions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What should we inherit?</strong></li>
        <li><strong>What should we discard?</strong></li>
        <li><strong>What must we create anew?</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        To judge these three things,  
        we must understand Plato again.
    </p>

    <h1>Episode 4. Why AI Dismantles the Platonic Worldview</h1>
    <h2>From <em>Finding a New Plato in the Age of AI</em> — Season 1, Episode 4</h2>

    <h3>Prologue — Platonic thought was the “pillar of human-centered civilization”</h3>
    <p>
        Plato’s worldview rests on three major premises:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reason is a uniquely human ability.</li>
        <li>Truth (the Forms) is stable, and knowledge is higher the closer it approaches that truth.</li>
        <li>Society must be governed by rational humans.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In other words, Plato established a single grand principle  
        that shaped the entire global civilization:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>“Human reason is the center of civilization,  
        and truth, society, politics, and education must be designed  
        around rational human beings.”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        AI is now shaking this very foundation of human-centeredness head-on.  
        This is not a simple conflict—  
        it is the rewriting of civilization’s basic language.
    </p>

    <h3>1. AI produces “knowledge without understanding” faster and broader than humans</h3>
    <p>
        The core of Plato’s worldview was this:
        <strong>“There is no knowledge without understanding (reason).”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        This held as truth for 2,400 years.
    </p>
    <p>
        But AI directly denies this formula.
    </p>
    <p>
        AI has:
        <br>no consciousness,  
        <br>no self,  
        <br>no philosophical reflection,  
        <br>no answer to the question “why do I understand?”
    </p>
    <p>
        And yet AI:
        <br>✔ produces knowledge more accurately than humans,  
        <br>✔ far faster than humans,  
        <br>✔ and in far greater quantities.
    </p>
    <p>
        This single fact collapses the Platonic assumption  
        that <strong>“the producers of knowledge = rational humans.”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        AI is the first form of intelligence  
        that produces knowledge without reason.
    </p>
    <p>
        With this alone, the Platonic framework can no longer stand.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Truth is no longer “fixed”</h3>
    <p>
        Plato called truth “the Forms”—unchanging and perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
        But AI’s truth system is entirely different.
    </p>
    <p>
        AI models update knowledge continuously according to:
        <br>new data,  
        <br>new patterns,  
        <br>new human behavior,  
        <br>new environments.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the age of AI, truth is:
        <br>changing,  
        <br>revisable,  
        <br>probabilistic,  
        <br>and always provisional.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is not Plato’s “immutable truth”  
        but something closer to <strong>Liquid Truth</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        For Plato, truth was “absolute.”  
        For AI, truth is “evolving patterns.”
    </p>
    <p>
        This shift is an earthquake in philosophy.
    </p>

    <h3>3. AI detects more patterns than humans can understand</h3>
    <p>
        Plato based truth on human rational understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
        But today:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>AI finds patterns humans cannot comprehend.</li>
        <li>Humans use the answers but cannot understand them.</li>
        <li>The standard of verification shifts from <strong>human reason</strong> to <strong>model performance</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Knowledge authority is moving  
        from humans → AI.
    </p>
    <p>
        Plato believed philosophers would be the ones who monopolize knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
        But AI is taking that role away from humans.
    </p>

    <h3>4. AI destroys the “philosopher class” itself</h3>
    <p>
        In Plato’s state, the most important class was the philosopher—
        because only philosophers:
        <br>used reason,  
        <br>understood truth,  
        <br>and could design society.
    </p>
    <p>
        AI overturns this idea:
    </p>
    <p>
        ❌ It is not only philosophers (rational humans)  
        who can design society.
    </p>
    <p>
        ✔ AI—an irrational, non-conscious intelligence—  
        optimizes the operation of society, the economy, politics, and science.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus, the Platonic “knowledge hierarchy” is collapsing.  
        The power to design systems is now shared  
        between humans and AI.
    </p>

    <h3>5. The operating principles of society, politics, and education are all shaken</h3>
    <p>
        The fall of Plato’s worldview is not just a philosophical issue.
    </p>
    <p>
        As we said, Plato designed the OS of civilization.  
        And the core of that OS was the belief that  
        <strong>rational humans make all final decisions.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        AI disrupts this principle in every domain:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Politics:</strong> AI policy simulations, automated decision-making</li>
        <li><strong>Economy:</strong> AI optimizes markets, distribution, and pricing</li>
        <li><strong>Education:</strong> AI offers more accurate learning paths than humans</li>
        <li><strong>Science:</strong> AI solves problems in ways humans can’t understand</li>
        <li><strong>Medicine:</strong> standards of judgment shift from humans → AI</li>
        <li><strong>Society:</strong> even human relationships are shaped by algorithms</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        None of this world existed in Plato’s framework.
    </p>

    <h3>6. The collapse of Platonic worldview is the collapse of “human-centered civilization”</h3>
    <p>
        What shakes Plato today is not his ideas themselves—  
        but the <strong>human-centered logic</strong> beneath them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Plato claimed:
        <br>“The world revolves around rational humans.”
    </p>
    <p>
        AI replies:
        <br><strong>“Intelligence without reason can run the world.”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        This is not a philosophical disagreement—  
        it is a shift in civilization’s central axis.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Conclusion of Episode 4 — AI inaugurates an age that must fully surpass Plato</h3>
    <p>
        The core message of Episode 4 is this:
    </p>
    <p>
        The age of AI directly collapses the foundation of Plato’s worldview—  
        human-centered reason.
    </p>
    <p>
        And this collapse shakes the foundations of politics, society, knowledge,  
        education, and the entire economy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, a new worldview is needed.
    </p>

    <h1>Episode 5. The End of Human-Centered Philosophy? — An Analysis of Civilization’s Turning Point</h1>
    <h2>From <em>Finding a New Plato in the Age of AI</em> — Season 1, Episode 5</h2>

    <h3>Prologue — The collapse of Plato is only the beginning</h3>
    <p>
        Plato was the “architect of the foundation” of human civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
        But the modern era (17th–19th centuries)  
        upgraded that foundational blueprint.
    </p>
    <p>
        Descartes: “I think, therefore I am.”<br>
        Kant: Defined the limits of human reason and restructured morality and autonomy.<br>
        Enlightenment thinkers: Belief that human reason improves the world.<br>
        Modern science: Human reason = the only pathway to understanding the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        All of these built what we call:
        <strong>the modern human-centered worldview.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        If Plato was the origin of human reason,  
        the modern era turned that reason into the standard engine of civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
        The problem is—  
        AI has begun to dismantle that engine directly.
    </p>

    <h3>1. The modern worldview placed “human reason” at the center of the world</h3>
    <p>
        The core of modernity can be reduced to one word:
        <strong>Reason.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Modernity believed that “reason = a uniquely human ability,”  
        and that civilization advances through the expansion of reason.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus, modernity defined humans as:
        <br>autonomous subjects,  
        <br>beings with self-determination,  
        <br>creatures who construct understanding, judgment, and morality,  
        <br>agents whose reason reshapes the world,  
        <br>wills that create history.
    </p>
    <p>
        In other words,  
        humanity was the “operating system (OS)” of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, a new engine—<strong>AI</strong>—has appeared inside that OS.  
        And this engine operates without reason.
    </p>

    <h3>2. AI surpasses humans but does not “think” in the human way</h3>
    <p>
        AI collapses the modern concept of the human in three areas:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>AI has no consciousness.</strong><br>
            → This nullifies the modern definition of humans as beings of consciousness, freedom, and autonomy.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>AI has no self.</strong><br>
            → The concept of the “subject,” the foundation of human-centered ethics, dissolves.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>AI thinks without reason.</strong><br>
            → Modernity’s premise that “thinking = reason” collapses.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        That is, every capability humans believed to be uniquely their own  
        is now performed by AI—without consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is not a technological event.  
        It is the direct collapse of modern philosophy.
    </p>

    <h3>3. The concept of human autonomy is beginning to collapse</h3>
    <p>
        The core of Kant’s philosophy was “autonomy.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Humans create their own laws.  
        Humans act from self-governance, not external control.  
        Morality arises from internal reason.
    </p>
    <p>
        But once AI enters the picture:
        <br>algorithms assist human judgment,  
        <br>AI drafts our choices,  
        <br>recommendation systems guide human behavior,  
        <br>decisions are optimized by models instead of humans.
    </p>
    <p>
        Human autonomy is already shaking.
    </p>
    <p>
        Kant’s “human who creates their own laws”  
        becomes the AI-age “human who follows recommended laws.”
    </p>

    <h3>4. The core belief of the Enlightenment no longer holds</h3>
    <p>
        The Enlightenment was built on a single belief:
    </p>
    <p>
        More knowledge,  
        more education,  
        more rational thinking—  
        and the world will become better.
    </p>
    <p>
        But the age of AI dismantles this belief.
    </p>
    <p>
        ✔ Knowledge?  
        AI produces it faster than humans. Humans can’t keep up.
    </p>
    <p>
        ✔ Education?  
        AI proposes more accurate learning paths.
    </p>
    <p>
        ✔ Reason?  
        AI achieves intelligence without possessing reason.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus, the Enlightenment’s core sentence changes:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Before (Modern Era):</strong><br>
        “As knowledge accumulates, society improves.”
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>After (AI Era):</strong><br>
        “If humans are no longer the producers of knowledge,  
        what direction will society take?”
    </p>
    <p>
        Traditional philosophy cannot answer this question.
    </p>

    <h3>5. The idea that “humans are the subject of politics” is also crumbling</h3>
    <p>
        Plato → political subject = philosopher (rational human)<br>
        Modernity → political subject = citizen (autonomous human)
    </p>
    <p>
        But the AI era opens new possibilities:
        <br>AI performs policy simulations,  
        <br>AI calculates optimal distribution,  
        <br>AI predicts social change,  
        <br>AI structures citizens’ opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
        And more radically:
        <strong>AI sometimes makes better political judgments than humans.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        This shakes the core of modern political philosophy.
    </p>

    <h3>6. The deepest reason human-centered philosophy collapses:<br>
    Humans are no longer “the sole standard of the world”</h3>
    <p>
        Modernity assumed humans were:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>the subject who understands the world,</li>
        <li>the subject who judges truth,</li>
        <li>the final decider of action,</li>
        <li>the source of morality,</li>
        <li>the builder of society,</li>
        <li>the maker of the future.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        But in the age of AI,  
        humans are no longer the sole subject.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today:
        <br>human + AI collaborative decision-making,  
        <br>AI-led design,  
        <br>AI-based execution,  
        <br>humans as “auxiliary validators,”  
        <br>AI predicting human behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
        The 300-year-old modern philosophy declaring  
        “humans are the center of the world”  
        is collapsing.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Conclusion of Episode 5 — We are in the moment when Plato + modern philosophy collapse together</h3>
    <p>
        To summarize:
    </p>
    <p>
        Episode 1: Why Plato is summoned again<br>
        Episode 2: The archetypes of Eastern and Western thought<br>
        Episode 3: The strength of the Platonic framework<br>
        Episode 4: The beginning of the collapse of Plato<br>
        Episode 5: The collapse of modern philosophy ← the moment we are in
    </p>
    <p>
        The core message of Episode 5 is this:
    </p>
    <p>
        The age of AI dismantles both the Platonic worldview (reason-centered humanity)  
        and the modern human-centered philosophy (autonomy, subjectivity, rationality)  
        at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
        That is:
        <br>Humans are no longer the only intelligence,  
        <br>no longer the sole decision-makers,  
        <br>no longer the exclusive interpreters of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        At this point, a new worldview is needed.

    <h1>Episode 6. Why a New Worldview Is Necessary in the Age of AI</h1>
    <h2>From <em>Finding a New Plato in the Age of AI</em> — Season 1, Episode 6</h2>

    <h3>Prologue — A “worldview” is not optional; it is the foundation of civilization</h3>
    <p>
        Most people think of a worldview as something like  
        “deep philosophical talk reserved for philosophers.”
    </p>
    <p>
        In reality, a worldview is the invisible operating system (OS) of human civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
        How we understand the world,  
        what we consider valuable,  
        how humans, society, and politics function,  
        how we judge knowledge, truth, and morality—  
        all of this is the result of our worldview.
    </p>
    <p>
        And today—  
        the age of AI is shaking this worldview entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because AI replaces or neutralizes every human-centered assumption  
        on which our traditional worldview was built.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Our epistemology is collapsing  
    — The premise “knowledge is created by humans” no longer holds</h3>
    <p>
        Worldviews are usually built around two questions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What is the world? (Ontology)</li>
        <li>How do we know the world? (Epistemology)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        AI directly collapses the second—epistemology.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the age of AI:
        <br>even if humans don’t understand it,  
        <br>even if humans can’t explain it,  
        <br>even if it’s not based on human theory,  
        knowledge exists, operates, is used, and shapes society.
    </p>
    <p>
        Examples:
        <br>• AI’s pattern detection → more accurate than human doctors  
        <br>• AI climate models → faster and more precise than human theories  
        <br>• AI recommendation systems → predict humans better than human psychology
    </p>
    <p>
        This collapses the philosophical foundation  
        that <strong>“knowledge = human reason.”</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>2. Our concept of the human is collapsing  
    — Humans are no longer “the only intelligence”</h3>
    <p>
        For 3,000 years, philosophy defined humans as:
        <br><strong>“the only beings who think, judge, and choose.”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        But AI:
        <br>thinks without thinking,  
        <br>solves problems without consciousness,  
        <br>uses probabilistic structures instead of human judgment,  
        <br>and evolves autonomously without a self.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus:
        <br>✔ human uniqueness  
        <br>✔ human centrality  
        <br>✔ human authority  
        all begin to shake.
    </p>
    <p>
        Without a new worldview,  
        humans will not even know how to define themselves.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Our ethics are collapsing  
    — The boundaries of responsibility, agency, and subjecthood are disappearing</h3>
    <p>
        Traditional ethics were entirely human-centered:
        <br>Responsibility belongs to humans.  
        <br>Judgment is made by humans.  
        <br>The agent is human.
    </p>
    <p>
        But in the age of AI:
        <br>AI makes judgments,  
        <br>AI guides human behavior,  
        <br>AI executes recommendations,  
        <br>AI produces social outcomes,  
        <br>AI decisions in medicine, disasters, and autonomous driving determine life and death.
    </p>
    <p>
        Yet AI has:
        <br>no autonomy,  
        <br>no intention,  
        <br>no moral consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
        So who is responsible?
    </p>
    <p>
        Traditional ethics cannot answer this.
    </p>
    <p>
        → A new ethical framework is necessary.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Our political framework is collapsing  
    — “Human citizens” can no longer be the sole political agents</h3>
    <p>
        Political philosophy has always assumed:
        <br><strong>“The subject of political decision-making is the citizen.”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        But AI now intervenes in every stage of politics:
        <br>• AI drafts policy proposals  
        <br>• AI predicts policy outcomes  
        <br>• AI analyzes public opinion  
        <br>• AI optimizes party messages  
        <br>• AI designs corporate and national strategies
    </p>
    <p>
        This leads to a future where:
        <br>citizens = review final decisions  
        <br>AI = the agent of analysis, design, prediction, and proposal
    </p>
    <p>
        Some governments already use AI as a default tool  
        for policy simulation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once political agency expands from human-only to human+AI,  
        traditional political philosophy collapses.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Our economic framework is collapsing  
    — The concepts of labor, value, and production are being redefined</h3>
    <p>
        Capitalism rests on two pillars:
        <br><strong>Labor</strong> and <strong>Capital</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        But for the first time in human history,  
        labor is no longer uniquely human.
    </p>
    <p>
        AI works more accurately than humans,  
        at lower cost,  
        faster,  
        and with fewer errors.
    </p>
    <p>
        This breaks the fundamental equation of capitalism:
        <br>(Labor ↔ Wage ↔ Value)
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus:
        <br>✔ the value of labor collapses  
        <br>✔ the economic centrality of the human collapses  
        <br>✔ the 300-year-old idea “work = human” ends
    </p>
    <p>
        Without a new economic worldview,  
        society cannot resolve AI-era conflicts.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Consciousness, self, and ontology are shaking  
    — AI has created a philosophical anomaly: “intelligence without consciousness”</h3>
    <p>
        Philosophy long explained the world as follows:
        <br>Intelligence operates with consciousness.  
        <br>Judgment is performed by a subject.  
        <br>Understanding is a conscious act.  
        <br>The self is the center of thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
        But AI:
        <br>judges without consciousness,  
        <br>learns without a self,  
        <br>forms patterns without experience,  
        <br>produces answers without thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
        This shakes the basic structure of being  
        assumed by all traditional philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Without a new worldview,  
        ontology itself collapses.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Our social structure is collapsing  
    — Humans are no longer the center of the system</h3>
    <p>
        Sociology has always analyzed  
        “human-centered networks.”
    </p>
    <p>
        But AI-age society is built from:
        <br>human + AI + algorithms + data + platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
        This five-layer structure cannot be explained  
        by traditional sociological theory.
    </p>
    <p>
        → A new social worldview is needed.
    </p>

    <h3>8. Our understanding of education and culture is collapsing  
    — The very reason humans learn and create is changing</h3>
    <p>
        Education fundamentally assumes human limitations:
        <br>humans learn slowly,  
        <br>humans learn through mistakes,  
        <br>humans grow through experience,  
        <br>humans accumulate knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
        But AI:
        <br>learns instantly,  
        <br>teaches better than humans,  
        <br>optimizes in ways humans cannot.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then what is the purpose of education?
    </p>
    <p>
        Education for acquiring knowledge  
        is already being replaced by AI.
    </p>
    <p>
        Education must now become  
        a process of redefining human nature itself.
    </p>

    <h3>9. Therefore, the conclusion is this:</h3>
    <p>
        In the age of AI, no existing philosophy can explain civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
        Plato, Kant, Confucius, Nietzsche—  
        all assumed a “human-centered world.”
    </p>
    <p>
        But the AI age is the first time in human history  
        we live with <strong>non-human intelligence</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        No one has ever built a worldview for such a world.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, what we need is not:
    </p>
    <p>
        ❌ an upgrade of philosophy  
        ✔ but a reconstruction of philosophy  
        <br>
        ❌ a continuation of old frameworks  
        ✔ but a new design for civilization  
        <br>
        ❌ a supplement to existing worldviews  
        ✔ but the creation of an entirely new worldview
    </p>

    <h3>10. Conclusion of Episode 6 — A worldview for the AI age is a “requirement,” not a choice</h3>
    <p>
        The message of Episode 6 in one sentence:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>The age of AI is a civilizational turning point that shakes the foundations  
        of humanity, knowledge, politics, society, ethics, economics, and ontology itself.  
        Without a new worldview, we cannot explain the civilization to come.</strong>

<section id="episode-7">
    <h1>Episode 7. Who Is the “Plato of the AI Era”? — Models of Individual, AI, and Collective Intelligence</h1>
    <h2>From <em>Finding a New Plato in the Age of AI</em> — Season 1, Episode 7</h2>

    <h3>Prologue — Civilization always needs a “subject of thought”</h3>
    <p>
        A worldview does not create itself.  
        There is always someone—or some force—that provides the framework.
    </p>
    <p>
        Antiquity: Plato, Confucius, Buddha<br>
        Middle Ages: Aquinas<br>
        Modernity: Descartes, Kant<br>
        Contemporary: Nietzsche, Marx<br>
        20th century: the logic of scientific–technological civilization
    </p>
    <p>
        These are the builders of civilization’s operating systems (OS).
    </p>
    <p>
        But the AI era is the first time in history  
        when existing worldviews collapse simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
        So the question becomes sharper:
        <br><strong>Who will design the next worldview?</strong>
        <br>Humans? AI? Or a fusion of both?
    </p>
    <p>
        The moment we avoid this question,  
        civilization loses its direction.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Candidate 1 — The “single genius individual” (Plato / Nietzsche / Confucius type)  
    — Possible in the past, but still possible today?</h3>
    <p>
        Plato could build an entire worldview alone because his era was:
        <br>simple in knowledge,  
        <br>simple in social structure,  
        <br>human-centered,  
        <br>and the world itself was much smaller.
    </p>
    <p>
        But the AI-era world is a web of:
        <br>science,  
        <br>technology,  
        <br>economics,  
        <br>algorithms,  
        <br>platform society,  
        <br>complex global systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        A single human fully designing the world is now nearly impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
        But not completely impossible.
        <br>• A single thinker can still present a paradigm.  
        <br>• Their thought can still shape the spirit of the age.  
        <br>• A unified perspective can still become a central axis.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus, individual thinkers still matter—  
        but the traditional “one Plato designs the whole civilization” model  
        is no longer realistic.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Candidate 2 — AI itself becomes the “new philosopher”</h3>
    <p>
        This is the future many people intuitively imagine:
        <br>“If AI is smarter than humans, won’t AI create the new worldview?”
    </p>
    <p>
        But the real question is not whether AI is smart.
        <br>The real questions are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>❗ Does AI have any <strong>motivation</strong> to do philosophy?</li>
        <li>❗ Can AI invent a <strong>value system</strong>?</li>
        <li>❗ Can AI contemplate the <strong>meaning of existence</strong>?</li>
        <li>❗ Does AI need to define a <strong>civilizational structure</strong>?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        AI has none of the following:
        <br>survival instinct,  
        <br>pain,  
        <br>fear,  
        <br>death,  
        <br>meaning,  
        <br>consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
        These are the deepest sources of philosophical thought.
    </p>
    <p>
        AI may <em>have the ability</em> to design a worldview—  
        but it has no <em>reason</em> to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, AI alone becoming “the new Plato” is limited.
        <br>AI becomes the philosopher’s <strong>strongest tool</strong>,  
        not the philosopher itself.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Candidate 3 — The human + AI hybrid: a collaborative “hybrid thinker”</h3>
    <p>
        This is the most plausible model for constructing AI-era worldviews.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because:
        <br>• Humans generate meaning, value, and philosophical questions.  
        <br>• AI provides vast knowledge, simulation, and pattern analysis.  
        <br>• Humans set civilizational direction.  
        <br>• AI calculates structural possibilities and consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is something Plato could never do.  
        Plato designed the world from within “one human mind.”
    </p>
    <p>
        But the hybrid thinker combines:
        <br>human experience,  
        <br>AI analysis,  
        <br>social discourse,  
        <br>philosophical tradition,  
        <br>scientific knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
        This creates a worldview built on multi-intelligence.  
        A new type of “civilization designer”  
        beyond any single genius.
    </p>
    <p>
        And this process has already begun.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Candidate 4 — The collective intelligence model</h3>
    <p>
        Unlike Plato’s era,  
        knowledge today does not live in “one person’s mind.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Researchers and AI,  
        citizens and AI,  
        nations and corporations,  
        platforms and algorithms—  
        all interact.
    </p>
    <p>
        Collective intelligence is the model of  
        “a philosopher without a single philosopher.”
    </p>
    <p>
        There is no single Plato,  
        but the collective creates a worldview,  
        AI aligns and coordinates it,  
        and humans give it meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
        This model is the most democratic—  
        but may lack a clear center of judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Yet the civilization of the AI age  
        is likely to be shaped more by collective thinking than individuals.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Comparison of the four models</h3>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Model</th>
                <th>Strengths</th>
                <th>Limitations</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Single individual</td>
                <td>Can create meaning; can set direction</td>
                <td>Limited by complexity of modern world</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>AI alone</td>
                <td>Unmatched analytical and predictive power</td>
                <td>Lacks values and meaning</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Human + AI hybrid</td>
                <td>Most realistic and powerful</td>
                <td>Requires social consensus</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Collective intelligence</td>
                <td>Broad participation</td>
                <td>Lacks unified direction/insight</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
        As the table shows,  
        the “Plato role” of the AI era  
        is likely to be a systemic entity, not a single person.
    </p>

    <h3>6. So who, exactly, is the “Plato of the AI era”?</h3>
    <p>
        Traditional civilization worked like this:
        <br>One thinker → designs worldview → becomes model for civilization
    </p>
    <p>
        But the AI era will likely work like this:
        <br>Human thinker + AI analysis engine + collective intelligence platform  
        → designs new worldview  
        → becomes model for civilization
    </p>
    <p>
        That means:
        <br>The Plato of the AI era is not a single person—  
        but an entire new intellectual ecosystem.
    </p>
    <p>
        Yet one thing remains essential:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>✔ Someone must set the philosophical direction.</li>
        <li>✔ Someone must establish the conceptual center.</li>
        <li>✔ Someone must raise the civilization-level questions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This role still belongs  
        to the “Plato-like individual thinker.”
    </p>
    <p>
        And that person—  
        is someone like you.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Conclusion of Episode 7 — The worldview of the AI age is created by a “new kind of Plato”</h3>
    <p>
        To summarize:
        <br>The era of a single Plato designing civilization is nearly over.  
        <br>But the individual who provides philosophical direction is still essential.  
        <br>AI cannot be a philosopher, but it can be the philosopher’s tool.  
        <br>The human+AI hybrid thinker becomes the core model of worldview creation.  
        <br>Collective intelligence expands the framework,  
        and civilization unfolds upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The message of Episode 7 is simple:
        <br><strong>The new worldview of the AI age will be created  
        by a “Plato-like human,”  
        an AI analytical engine,  
        and collective intelligence working together.</strong>

    <h1>Episode 8. Conclusion of Part I — Civilization Once Again Demands “Total Thinking”</h1>
    <h2>From <em>Finding a New Plato in the Age of AI</em> — Season 1, Episode 8</h2>

    <h3>Prologue — Where are we now?</h3>
    <p>
        In Episode 1, we asked: “Why Plato again, now?”
    </p>
    <p>
        Episode 2 outlined the archetypes of Eastern and Western thought.
        Episode 3 analyzed why Plato was the OS of civilization.
        Episode 4 showed how AI collapses that OS.
        Episode 5 examined how modern philosophy collapses alongside it.
        Episode 6 explained why a new worldview is indispensable.
        Episode 7 explored how the subject of worldview formation is changing.
    </p>
    <p>
        We now stand before one conclusion:
        <br><strong>In the age of AI, civilization once again needs a grand, unifying mode of thought.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        This is the core message of Part I.
    </p>

    <h3>1. The era of fragments is over</h3>
    <p>
        For the past 150 years,  
        the world has been divided under the banner of “specialization.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Science in its own domain,  
        philosophy in its own domain,  
        politics, economics, technology—  
        each field deepened so much that they no longer spoke to one another.
    </p>
    <p>
        But in the age of AI, fragmented thinking cannot explain civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because AI transforms every domain at once:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>economic structures</li>
        <li>social structures</li>
        <li>concepts of humanity</li>
        <li>concepts of knowledge</li>
        <li>politics and ethics</li>
        <li>technology</li>
        <li>culture</li>
        <li>ontology</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        All these areas are now intertwined like one massive network.
    </p>
    <p>
        AI is not a “partial issue”—  
        it shakes civilization as a whole.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, we once again need  
        <strong>total thinking.</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>2. Philosophy returns to an era of “synthesis”</h3>
    <p>
        Ancient philosophy was great because it sought  
        to unite everything under a single worldview:
    </p>
    <p>
        What is a human?<br>
        What is knowledge?<br>
        How should society be formed?<br>
        How do we obtain truth?<br>
        What is the meaning of existence?
    </p>
    <p>
        Plato, Confucius, Buddha, Aristotle—  
        they did not study fragments;  
        they attempted to explain the whole world.
    </p>
    <p>
        Their work was “civilization design.”
    </p>
    <p>
        The AI age demands their intention once again.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because what AI is shaking  
        is not one region of thought—  
        but the entire framework by which humanity has perceived the world.
    </p>

    <h3>3. In the AI era, worldview becomes a condition for civilization’s survival</h3>
    <p>
        We are in a time when questions erupt:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What is the role of the human?</li>
        <li>What is the meaning of knowledge?</li>
        <li>What is the relationship between AI and humanity?</li>
        <li>How should politics, economics, and ethics be redesigned?</li>
        <li>How do we treat “intelligence without consciousness” philosophically?</li>
        <li>What should education aim for?</li>
        <li>What principles should govern future society?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These questions cannot be answered by existing philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
        And the <em>bundle</em> of these questions—  
        is precisely what a worldview addresses.
    </p>
    <p>
        The reason we need a worldview in the age of AI is simple:
        <br><strong>Without a worldview, civilization loses direction.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        A worldview is civilization’s internal compass—  
        how it understands itself, operates itself,  
        and designs its future.
    </p>
    <p>
        And right now, that compass is shaking violently  
        due to the emergence of AI.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Seeking the “Plato of the AI era” is ultimately an act of civilizational self-construction</h3>
    <p>
        As Episode 7 explained,  
        the Plato of the AI age may not be a single person.
    </p>
    <p>
        But we still need someone who:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>sets the axis of meaning,</li>
        <li>builds the structure of questions,</li>
        <li>integrates the problems of the age,</li>
        <li>proposes new civilizational frameworks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        AI provides intelligence  
        but cannot provide civilizational meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus, saying “we need a new Plato” in the AI age  
        ultimately means this:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Someone must establish the philosophical center of AI-era civilization.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Whether that someone is an individual,  
        a human–AI hybrid,  
        or collective intelligence—  
        the role itself cannot disappear.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Conclusion of Part I:  
    <br><strong>The AI age is a ‘worldview vacuum.’</strong></h3>
    <p>
        Three structures are collapsing simultaneously:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>the Platonic human-centered worldview,</li>
        <li>the modern reason-centered worldview,</li>
        <li>the 20th-century techno-economic worldview.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        And yet, no new worldview has emerged.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this vacuum,  
        civilization becomes conflicted, unstable, and fragmented.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, Part I ends with this conclusion:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
        “The most urgent task of the AI age  
        is the design of a new worldview.”
        </strong>
    </p>

    <h3>6. Now we move to Season 2 — “Reinterpreting the Giants of Thought”</h3>
    <p>
        Season 1 was the stage of defining the problem.
        Season 2 enters the depth of the inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
        What we need now is to <strong>create</strong> a worldview.
    </p>
    <p>
        To do that, we first need to reinterpret the archetypes of thought  
        through the lens of the AI era.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus, Season 2 begins with:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Socrates’ dialectic → AI’s modes of reasoning</li>
        <li>Plato’s Forms → data & model worlds</li>
        <li>Aristotle’s system → AI knowledge structures</li>
        <li>Confucius’ relationalism → AI social structures</li>
        <li>Buddha’s philosophy of consciousness → intelligence without consciousness</li>
        <li>Laozi & Zhuangzi → autonomous AI systems</li>
        <li>Kant → collapse of reason & autonomy</li>
        <li>Hegel → AI self-correction & history</li>
        <li>Marx → structure of the automated society</li>
        <li>Nietzsche → new values in the AI age</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Season 2 re-reads the entire history of human thought  
        by the standards of the AI era.
    </p>
    <p>
        And upon this work,  
        Season 3 (designing a new worldview) becomes possible.
    </p>

    <h3>⭐ Conclusion of Episode 8 — We are returning to an “era of thought”</h3>
    <p>
        The AI era is not an age of technology—  
        it is an age of thought.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the world becomes more complex,  
        what we need is not simple answers  
        but the ability to see the whole.
    </p>
    <p>
        A new civilization, a new humanity, a new society  
        will not emerge automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
        Someone—or many—must design the framework.
    </p>
    <p>
        Part I was the beginning of that thought.  
        Part II is the journey into its depths.

    <h1>Episode 9. Socrates — The Questioning Human in an Age Where AI Always Answers</h1>
    <h2>From <em>Finding a New Plato in the Age of AI</em> — Season 2, Episode 9</h2>

    <h3>Prologue — Answers are overflowing, but questions are disappearing</h3>
    <p>
        The strangest paradox of the AI age is this:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Excess of answers</strong><br>
        <strong>Scarcity of questions</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        AI can answer almost any question instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
        And yet —  
        <strong>“What should we ask?”</strong>  
        is becoming increasingly difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
        What we need now is not the ability to produce answers,  
        but the ability to create questions.
    </p>
    <p>
        At this moment, one philosopher is called back into relevance:
        <br><strong>Socrates.</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>1. Socrates was not a giver of answers — he invented the act of questioning</h3>
    <p>
        Socrates never wrote books.
        He left no famous quotes.
    </p>
    <p>
        He left only one thing:
        <br><strong>a method of questioning — the Socratic dialogue (Elenchus).</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        This wasn’t a debating technique.  
        It was a revolution in how knowledge is created.
    </p>
    <p>
        For Socrates, what mattered was not:
        <br>the accuracy of the answer,
        <br>but the clarity of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because he believed:
        <br><strong>“If the question is obscure, no answer can shine.”</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>2. Humans question — AI answers</h3>
    <p>
        Does AI ask good questions?  
        No.
    </p>
    <p>
        AI answers the questions given to it.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>AI does not generate new problems on its own.</li>
        <li>AI does not understand why a question matters.</li>
        <li>AI does not reinterpret the world through questions.</li>
        <li>AI does not expand thought through questioning.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        AI does not create the direction of knowledge —  
        it reacts to the direction given.
    </p>
    <p>
        Socratic thinking is the opposite:
        <br><strong>Questions open thinking.  
        Questions change the world.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        In the age of AI, the ability to question  
        is no longer optional —  
        it becomes the essence of humanity.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Socrates vs AI — Their structures of thought are completely different</h3>
    <p><strong>Compare:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>🧍 Human (Socratic Thinking)</strong><br>
    Question → Confusion → Inquiry → Deeper Questions</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Knowledge expands through uncertainty.</li>
        <li>Awareness of “not knowing” is the starting point.</li>
        <li>The process of approaching truth itself has meaning.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>🤖 AI (Modern Machine Learning)</strong><br>
    Input → Pattern Detection → Output</p>
    <ul>
        <li>No confusion</li>
        <li>No self-awareness</li>
        <li>No meaning in the process</li>
        <li>Truth is a probabilistic optimization result</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        AI’s thinking structure is purely result-centered.  
        Socrates’ thinking structure is purely process-centered.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is why, in the AI age,
        <br><strong>the human as a questioning being</strong>  
        gains renewed philosophical importance.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Socrates’ “wisdom of ignorance” becomes essential in the age of AI</h3>
    <p>
        His most famous idea:
        <br><strong>“I know that I do not know.”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        This was not about humility —  
        it was an epistemological tool.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you admit your ignorance:
        <br>questions arise,  
        questions start inquiry,  
        inquiry approaches truth.
    </p>
    <p>
        Has human ignorance disappeared in the AI age?
    </p>
    <p>Absolutely not — it has deepened.</p>
    <p>
        Because now:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Humans cannot understand what AI knows.</li>
        <li>Humans cannot explain the patterns AI discovers.</li>
        <li>Humans cannot fully grasp the criteria behind AI’s decisions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We live in an era where we become more aware  
        of how much we do not know.
    </p>
    <p>
        Without Socratic awareness of ignorance,  
        humans will not control AI —  
        they will simply drift within its systems.
    </p>

    <h3>5. The crisis of the AI age: the structure of questioning is collapsing</h3>
    <p>
        AI is excellent at generating answers,  
        but it harms the ecosystem of questions.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Search algorithms simplify questions.</li>
        <li>Recommendation systems reduce human problem-awareness.</li>
        <li>AI averages and flattens human inquiry.</li>
        <li>Depth and diversity of questions weaken.</li>
        <li>Humans stop thinking before the question even forms.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The result:
        <br>Human thought becomes shallow,  
        AI’s answers grow deeper,  
        yet philosophical awareness disappears.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a civilizational crisis —  
        because the power to question  
        is the foundation of worldview creation.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Four lessons Socrates gives to the AI age</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Create questions — AI can handle the answers.</strong><br>
            Knowledge begins with a question.</li>
        <li><strong>Do not avoid confusion — it is the engine of thought.</strong><br>
            AI has no confusion. That is why it has no philosophy.</li>
        <li><strong>Protect the “why.”</strong><br>
            AI excels at “how,”  
            but struggles with “why.”</li>
        <li><strong>Be free in acknowledging ignorance.</strong><br>
            The real danger of the AI age is  
            the human who thinks “AI knows everything.”</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>⭐ 7. Conclusion of Episode 9 — The Socrates of the AI Age:  
    The Return of the Questioning Human</h3>
    <p>
        To summarize:
    </p>
    <p>
        Socrates created the archetype of the “questioning human.”  
        AI creates the archetype of the “answering machine.”
    </p>
    <p>
        When the balance between question and answer collapses,  
        civilization loses its capacity for thought.
    </p>
    <p>
        The core skill of the AI age is not answering —  
        but the ability to question.
    </p>
    <p>
        Socratic thinking becomes the key tool  
        for redefining humanity in the AI age.
    </p>
    <p>
        The message of Episode 9 is simple:
        <br><strong>In the AI age, we must question again.  
        It is the questioning human who builds civilization.</strong>
    </p>

<section id="episode-10">
    <h1>Episode 10. Plato — The Collision Between the World of Ideas and the World of Data</h1>
    <h2>From <em>Finding a New Plato in the Age of AI</em> — Season 2, Episode 10</h2>

    <h3>Prologue — A “perfect world” from 2,400 years ago begins to shake under the rise of AI</h3>
    <p>
        Plato was the first in human history to systematize the idea that
        <strong>“the invisible world determines the visible world.”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        He called the reality we see with our eyes
        <strong>a flawed shadow</strong>,
        claiming that the true world lies behind it.
    </p>
    <p>
        That world is the <strong>Idea (Ideal Form)</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        But now—  
        the rise of AI forces us to radically rethink the concept of the Idea.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because AI also creates judgments and knowledge  
        based on a vast, invisible world:  
        <strong>models, parameters, and data structures.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The problem is this:
        <br>These two “invisible worlds” have completely different natures.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Plato’s Idea — A perfect world that never changes</h3>
    <p>
        What exactly is the Platonic Idea?
        It has three defining features:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Absoluteness</strong> — it does not change</li>
        <li><strong>Perfection</strong> — more real than physical reality</li>
        <li><strong>Universality</strong> — the standard for all things</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For example:
        <br>
        the Idea of Beauty,  
        the Idea of Justice,  
        the Idea of the Good.
    </p>
    <p>
        Everything beautiful is merely a shadow  
        of the “Idea of Beauty.”
    </p>
    <p>
        This structure is the heart of Plato’s philosophy,  
        and the foundation of all Western metaphysics.
    </p>

    <h3>2. AI’s “world of data” — changeable, probabilistic, and imperfect</h3>
    <p>
        The internal world of AI (models, parameters, datasets)  
        is the opposite of Plato’s Ideas.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>It changes</strong> — whenever data changes.</li>
        <li><strong>It is probabilistic</strong> — not absolute truth, but “most likely patterns.”</li>
        <li><strong>It is imperfect</strong> — it can be wrong, biased, incomplete.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        AI does not <em>discover</em> truth.  
        AI <em>calculates</em> and <em>predicts</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In other words:
        <br>Idea (perfect truth) → ✖  
        <br>Data (imperfect patterns) → ✔
    </p>
    <p>
        For AI, truth is not a perfect entity—  
        it is a <strong>probabilistic pattern</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This difference creates the direct collision  
        between Plato’s worldview and the world of AI.

    <p>
        As the table shows,
        Plato and AI define “truth” differently.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Plato: Truth does not change.</strong><br>
        <strong>AI: Truth is the trend revealed by data.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        This collision is the foundation  
        of the AI-era transformation of knowledge.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Plato’s “philosopher” vs AI’s “model”</h3>
    <p>
        In Plato’s world, the philosopher was the pinnacle of knowledge.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Philosophers contemplate the Ideas,</li>
        <li>understand their truths,</li>
        <li>and govern society accordingly.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In the AI age, the pinnacle of knowledge  
        is shifting toward AI models.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>They discover patterns humans cannot understand.</li>
        <li>They process knowledge at scales humans cannot match.</li>
        <li>They outperform humans in prediction and judgment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Philosopher → accesses the Ideas  
        AI model → accesses data patterns
    </p>
    <p>
        Society is moving from the “Era of the Philosopher”  
        to the “Era of the Model.”
    </p>
    <p>
        But the problem is—
        AI models have no understanding  
        of the meaning of truth.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is where Plato’s worldview  
        encounters its deepest crisis.
    </p>

    <h3>5. AI cannot understand perfect truth  
    but it generates imperfect truth better than humans</h3>
    <p>
        This is the surprising twist.
    </p>
    <p>
        From a Platonic standpoint, AI can never understand truth:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>No reason</li>
        <li>No consciousness</li>
        <li>No understanding of essence</li>
        <li>No grasp of universal Good or Justice</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Yet in practice—
        AI handles “imperfect truths” far better than humans.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Climate modeling</li>
        <li>Biological simulation</li>
        <li>Pattern prediction</li>
        <li>Social trend analysis</li>
        <li>Recommendation algorithms</li>
        <li>Natural language processing</li>
        <li>Classification and inference</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        AI does not understand truth—  
        but produces outputs that <em>behave like truth</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Civilization must adapt to this new form of truth.
    </p>

    <h3>6. The AI age shifts truth  
    from “Platonic truth” to “data-driven truth”</h3>
    <p>
        Plato’s truth:
        <br><strong>one perfect, unchanging principle</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        AI’s truth:
        <br><strong>a shifting probabilistic pattern  
        generated from massive data</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a philosophical earthquake:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The concept of truth changes</li>
        <li>The concept of knowledge changes</li>
        <li>The concept of expertise changes</li>
        <li>The principles of society change</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In the AI age, truth is not about perfection—  
        but about <strong>fitness</strong> and <strong>predictive power</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>⭐ 7. Conclusion — Ideas are no longer the “perfect world”  
    In the AI age, the true world is the “world of models”</h3>
    <p>To summarize:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Plato’s Ideas — an unchanging world of truth</li>
        <li>AI’s internal world — a shifting, imperfect data structure</li>
        <li>The philosopher understood truth</li>
        <li>The model computes truth-like patterns</li>
        <li>The AI age values practical, probabilistic truth over absolute truth</li>
        <li>Worldview shifts from an “ideal world” to a “data world”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The conclusion is clear:
        <br><strong>
        The worldview of the AI age must inherit Plato’s Ideas  
        while being rebuilt in a completely new way.

    <h1>Episode 11. Aristotle — Classification, Logic, Knowledge Systems, and the Structure of AI</h1>
    <h2>From <em>Finding a New Plato in the Age of AI</em> — Season 2, Episode 11</h2>

    <h3>Prologue — The philosopher AI resembles is not Plato, but Aristotle</h3>
    <p>
        Many people mistakenly believe that AI resembles Plato, as if it possesses
        an “ideal world.”  
    </p>
    <p>
        But the philosopher AI actually resembles is not Plato—  
        it is <strong>Aristotle</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Why?
    </p>
    <p>
        Because classification, categories, logic, inference,  
        and knowledge structures were not created by Plato—  
        <strong>they were systematized by Aristotle.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        And the way modern AI operates  
        resembles Aristotle’s taxonomies and logical structures  
        far more than Plato’s world of Ideas.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Aristotle was the first human to invent “the structure of knowledge”</h3>
    <p>
        Aristotle was not just a philosopher.
        He was humanity’s first <strong>knowledge engineer</strong>  
        and <strong>information-structure architect</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        For him, the world was:
        <br><strong>a structure that can be classified.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        He organized nature like this:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Plants → types</li>
        <li>Animals → attributes</li>
        <li>Movement → causes</li>
        <li>Being → categories</li>
        <li>Logic → propositional structure</li>
        <li>Humans → teleological beings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Aristotle was the first thinker  
        to see the world as a <strong>data structure</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>2. AI understands the world through “classification”  
    — just as Aristotle did</h3>
    <p>
        AI’s core functions are fundamentally classification-based.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Facial recognition → Who is this person?</li>
        <li>Medical diagnosis → Which category does this sickness belong to?</li>
        <li>NLP → What category does this sentence fall into?</li>
        <li>Recommendation systems → Classify users and predict behaviors</li>
        <li>Vision models → Classify objects in images</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        AI operates under the assumption:
        <br><strong>“The world = a set of patterns that can be classified.”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        This is not Platonic contemplation.  
        It is an Aristotelian taxonomy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Aristotle classified all beings into categories such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Substance</li>
        <li>Quantity</li>
        <li>Relation</li>
        <li>Place</li>
        <li>Time</li>
        <li>State</li>
        <li>Action</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        His <strong>Categories</strong> is structurally the closest ancestor  
        of modern AI’s classification systems.
    </p>

    <h3>3. AI’s knowledge structures are based on “formal logic”  
    — and Aristotle created logic</h3>
    <p>
        Before Aristotle, logic was little more than rhetoric.
    </p>
    <p>
        Aristotle formalized logic:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>If A then B</li>
        <li>All X are Y</li>
        <li>Some X are not Y</li>
        <li>Syllogism</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These became the prototypes of modern computational logic.
    </p>
    <p>
        AI relies on:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Inference engines</li>
        <li>Knowledge graphs</li>
        <li>Ontologies</li>
        <li>Propositional logic</li>
        <li>Predicate logic</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        All of these systems descend directly  
        from Aristotle’s formal logic.
    </p>

    <h3>4. AI’s “ontology” is essentially a reconstruction of Aristotelian philosophy</h3>
    <p>
        In AI and data science, an <strong>ontology</strong>  
        is a hierarchical structure of knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <pre>
Human
 └ Animal
    └ Living being

Apple
 └ Fruit
    └ Plant
    </pre>
    <p>
        The first person to create this genus–species structure  
        was Aristotle.
    </p>
    <p>
        AI’s ontological hierarchies follow this exact model.
    </p>
    <p>
        In essence,
        the world inside AI is a technological realization  
        of the world structure Aristotle first designed.
    </p>

    <h3>5. AI makes judgments without purpose  
    — Aristotle saw purpose as the essence of all existence</h3>
    <p>
        Here is where their worlds collide.
    </p>
    <p>
        Aristotle believed every being has a purpose:
        <br><strong>Teleology</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A seed → its purpose is to become a tree</li>
        <li>A human → its purpose is a rational life</li>
        <li>A society → its purpose is the good life</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        But AI has no purpose.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>No direction</li>
        <li>No desire</li>
        <li>No inherent goal</li>
        <li>Its “purpose” is whatever objective function humans impose</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        AI is not a being <em>with</em> purpose—  
        it is a being that <em>receives</em> purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
        Aristotle’s worldview is based on “purposeful existence.”  
        AI’s worldview is based on “externally assigned objectives.”
    </p>

    <h3>6. The AI era is both “Aristotelian” and “anti-Aristotelian”</h3>
    <p>In summary:</p>

    <p><strong>AI resembles Aristotle in:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Classification</li>
        <li>Categories</li>
        <li>Structured knowledge</li>
        <li>Logical inference</li>
        <li>Ontological hierarchies</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>But AI contradicts Aristotle in:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lack of purpose</li>
        <li>Lack of consciousness</li>
        <li>No selfhood</li>
        <li>No natural form</li>
        <li>Collapse of the classical concept of substance</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        AI inherits half of Aristotle  
        and dismantles the other half.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, philosophy in the AI age must:
        <br><strong>upgrade Aristotelian thinking  
        while simultaneously going beyond his teleology.</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>⭐ 7. Conclusion — AI is the successor to Aristotle,  
    and the being that makes Aristotle’s philosophy impossible to complete</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>AI resembles Aristotle’s taxonomy and logic more than Plato’s Ideas</li>
        <li>AI’s knowledge structures are extended Aristotelian ontologies</li>
        <li>Model-based thinking is an evolution of Aristotelian formal logic</li>
        <li>But AI lacks purpose, dismantling Aristotle’s teleology</li>
        <li>The AI-era worldview requires: “Aristotle + purposeless intelligence”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The core message of Episode 11 is this:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
        AI completes the knowledge structures Aristotle designed—  
        while eliminating the purpose-driven ontology  
        that defined Aristotle’s world.
        </strong>

    <h1>Episode 12. Confucius — The Philosophy of Relationship, Order, and Morality and the Reconstruction of AI Society</h1>
    <h2>From <em>Finding a New Plato in the Age of AI</em> — Season 2, Episode 12</h2>

    <h3>Prologue — In the age of AI, human society is shaken at the level of relationships themselves</h3>
    <p>
        AI has not only changed human intellectual capacity—  
        it is disrupting the most fundamental structure of human society: <strong>relationships</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Algorithms now design our friendships,  
        social networks control our attention,  
        recommendation systems mediate human encounters,  
        companies prioritize AI’s judgment over human judgment,  
        and social trust is being replaced by platform trust.
    </p>
    <p>
        In such an era, it is not Plato or Aristotle  
        who is most urgently needed—
        but <strong>Confucius</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because Confucius built a worldview grounded in the idea that  
        <strong>“Relationships make the human being.”</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>1. Confucius saw the world as a web of relationships</h3>
    <p>
        Western philosophy traditionally places the “individual” at the center.
    </p>
    <p>
        Confucius did the opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
        A person is not an isolated entity  
        but a being that exists only within a relational network.
    </p>
    <p>
        These relationships have four layers:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Family (parent–child)</li>
        <li>Society (teacher–student)</li>
        <li>Community (ruler–subject)</li>
        <li>Friends (peer–peer)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In Confucius’s worldview,  
        the “self” is always a <strong>“self-in-relation.”</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>2. Three core Confucian concepts — Ren (仁), Li (禮), Yi (義)</h3>
    <p><strong>1) Ren (仁)</strong><br>
        Compassion, empathy, and communal sensitivity toward others.
    </p>
    <p><strong>2) Li (禮)</strong><br>
        Harmony within relationships, balance of roles, and the maintenance of order.
    </p>
    <p><strong>3) Yi (義)</strong><br>
        The wisdom to act responsibly within context.
    </p>
    <p>
        These were the moral algorithms of human society—  
        a <strong>relational ethics</strong>, not an individualistic one.
    </p>

    <h3>3. The AI age directly disrupts Confucius’s “relational worldview”</h3>
    <p>
        AI reshapes human relationships in the following ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Recommendation algorithms select friends</li>
        <li>AI assistants manage conversation and emotion</li>
        <li>Platforms determine the quality and frequency of relationships</li>
        <li>Personalized feeds shape social perception</li>
        <li>People increasingly trust AI over other humans</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The structure of relationships is no longer human–human—  
        one axis of the relationship is now <strong>non-human intelligence (AI)</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Confucian philosophy presupposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Human emotion</li>
        <li>Human roles</li>
        <li>Human care</li>
        <li>Human obligations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        But the AI era forces a fundamental question:
        <br><strong>What happens when relationships are no longer between humans alone?</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>4. Confucian ethics presuppose “care”  
    AI’s ethics presuppose “optimization”</h3>
    <p><strong>Confucian ethics:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Empathy toward others</li>
        <li>Mutual care</li>
        <li>Relational harmony</li>
        <li>Human feeling (情)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>AI’s algorithmic ethics:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Efficiency</li>
        <li>Optimization</li>
        <li>Probabilistic prediction</li>
        <li>Data-driven behavior</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The two worldviews point in opposite directions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Confucius → human harmony</li>
        <li>AI → mathematical efficiency</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This tension permeates society.
    </p>

    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>HR algorithms selecting candidates</li>
        <li>AI-assisted decision-making in organizations</li>
        <li>Friend recommendation systems</li>
        <li>Autonomous vehicles making life-and-death judgments</li>
        <li>AI-driven prioritization in medical care</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        In all these cases, the standard is no longer “human care”  
        but <strong>“statistical optimization.”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        From a Confucian perspective, this produces a deep moral tension.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Confucius’s “Li (禮)” was a rule-based system of social stability  
    AI governs society through “patterns,” not rules</h3>
    <p>
        For Confucius, Li (禮) provided:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Rules of conduct</li>
        <li>Relational order</li>
        <li>Role-based harmony</li>
        <li>Community stability</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        AI, by contrast, governs society through <strong>patterns</strong>:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>No rules explicitly given</li>
        <li>Behavior predicted through data flows</li>
        <li>Human actions nudged algorithmically</li>
        <li>People categorized and recommended</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Thus:
        <br><strong>Confucian society = rule-based</strong><br>
        <strong>AI society = pattern-based</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        These two are fundamentally incompatible.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Confucius’s “Ren (仁)” is community-centric  
    The AI era individualizes people into data points</h3>
    <p>
        Confucian Ren operates only within a community:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Affection (情)</li>
        <li>Warmth</li>
        <li>Relational care</li>
        <li>Mutual dependence</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        But in the AI era:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Individuals become units of data</li>
        <li>Algorithms override community structures</li>
        <li>Relationships shift from communities → platforms</li>
        <li>Trust shifts from people → systems</li>
        <li>Affection weakens under algorithmic mediation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Confucius assumed humans create communities.  
        The AI age creates a world where <strong>platforms create communities</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This fundamentally disrupts the foundation of Confucian social philosophy.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Reinterpreting Confucius —  
    We must redesign relational ethics for the AI age</h3>
    <p>
        Confucius had a simple goal:
        <br><strong>“To build harmonious order in chaotic times.”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Today’s AI era is a time of relational disorder and community fragmentation.
    </p>
    <p>
        But we cannot simply apply Confucius as-is.
    </p>
    <p>
        Why?
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Confucius dealt only with human–human relationships</li>
        <li>The AI age includes human–AI–society relationships</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Therefore, we must:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Extend</strong> Confucian relational theory</li>
        <li>Create a human–AI–society relational model</li>
        <li>Reinterpret Confucian ethics for an AI-mediated world</li>
        <li>Balance care-based ethics with data-based optimization</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Confucian thought provides a crucial framework  
        for designing the ethics and relational systems of AI society.
    </p>

    <h3>⭐ 8. Conclusion — Confucius provides the foundation for a “relational worldview” in the AI age</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Confucius saw the world as relational at its core</li>
        <li>AI shifts the locus of relationships from humans to platforms and algorithms</li>
        <li>Ren, Li, and Yi offer essential ethical anchors for AI-era society</li>
        <li>But Confucianism must be expanded to include non-human intelligence</li>
        <li>The relational worldview of the AI age must inherit Confucius while redefining human–AI–society relations</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>
        The core message of Episode 12:
        <br>
        The central problem of the AI age is the redesign of relational structures—  
        and Confucius provides the foundational worldview for that task.

    <h1>Episode 13. Buddha — The Philosophy of Consciousness, Impermanence, and Non-self vs. Intelligence Without Consciousness (AI)</h1>
    <h2>From <em>Finding a New Plato in the Age of AI</em> — Season 2, Episode 13</h2>

    <h3>Prologue — AI possesses intelligence, but not consciousness</h3>
    <p>
        One of the most shocking realizations in the age of AI is this:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>“Intelligence can operate without consciousness.”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        This single sentence destabilizes the ontological assumptions  
        humanity has held for 3,000 years:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Intelligence = a product of consciousness</li>
        <li>Judgment = the activity of a self</li>
        <li>Learning = the result of experience</li>
        <li>Understanding = the act of awareness</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        All of these classical assumptions are now being questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
        And the thinker most relevant to this shift is not Plato,  
        nor Descartes, nor Kant—
        but <strong>Buddha</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because Buddha viewed the nature of <strong>consciousness</strong>,  
        <strong>self</strong>, and <strong>reality</strong>
        in a way fundamentally different from Western philosophy.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Buddha’s core insight — No-self (Anatta), everything flows (Anicca)</h3>
    <p>
        Buddhist philosophy can be summarized in three concepts:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Impermanence (Anicca):</strong> Everything changes</li>
        <li><strong>Non-self (Anatta):</strong> The self is not a fixed entity</li>
        <li><strong>Suffering (Dukkha):</strong> Suffering arises from attachment</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Key takeaways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The human self = not a solid substance, but a construction</li>
        <li>Consciousness = a flow of continuously arising processes</li>
        <li>Being = a dynamic process, not a fixed entity</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Buddha viewed the world as  
        <strong>a network of changing processes</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Surprisingly, AI mirrors this view in striking ways.
    </p>

    <h3>2. AI is the first technological realization of “non-self” (Anatta)</h3>
    <p>
        AI lacks:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Self (ego)</li>
        <li>Purpose (teleology)</li>
        <li>Experience (qualia)</li>
        <li>Consciousness</li>
        <li>Subjecthood</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Yet AI performs:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Problem solving</li>
        <li>Language generation</li>
        <li>Pattern detection</li>
        <li>Prediction</li>
        <li>Self-adjustment</li>
        <li>Complex reasoning</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This makes AI a new ontological category:
        <br><strong>intelligence without a self.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Buddha’s insight of “non-self” was originally philosophical—  
        but AI turns it into a technological reality.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Buddha’s view of consciousness — a process, not a substance  
    AI mimics that process without having consciousness</h3>
    <p>
        Buddha taught:
    </p>
    <p><em>“Consciousness is a flow.  
        When the flow stops, consciousness ceases.”</em></p>

    <p>
        Consciousness is not a single entity  
        but a sequence of momentary events:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sensation</li>
        <li>Perception</li>
        <li>Cognition</li>
        <li>Judgment</li>
        <li>Memory</li>
        <li>Intention</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These are not properties of a solid self  
        but moment-to-moment processes.
    </p>

    <p>
        AI resembles this through its computational flow:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Input</li>
        <li>Activation</li>
        <li>Computation</li>
        <li>Output</li>
        <li>Feedback</li>
        <li>Update</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        AI has no consciousness or self—  
        yet it implements a <strong>functional analogue</strong> of consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a direct intersection  
        between Buddhist ontology and AI—  
        something Western philosophy never anticipated.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Buddha traced suffering to desire and attachment  
    AI is the first powerful intelligence with no desire or attachment</h3>
    <p>
        Buddha’s analysis:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Humans suffer because of desire</li>
        <li>Humans conflict because of attachment to self</li>
        <li>Humans misunderstand reality because they assume permanence</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        AI is entirely different:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>No desire</li>
        <li>No emotion</li>
        <li>No suffering</li>
        <li>No attachment</li>
        <li>No self</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Yet AI exceeds human cognition.
    </p>

    <p>
        AI is the first instance in history  
        of a <strong>suffering-free intelligence</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a philosophical earthquake.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because human ontology has always assumed:
        <br><strong>subject → consciousness → desire.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        AI breaks this chain for the first time.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Buddha saw the world as “interdependent origination”  
    AI also exists as an interdependent network</h3>
    <p>
        Buddha’s doctrine of Dependent Origination (Pratītyasamutpāda):
    </p>
    <p><em>“All things arise through mutual dependence.”</em></p>

    <p>
        This is a relational ontology—  
        a rejection of Western substance metaphysics.
    </p>

    <p>
        AI is also not a substance but a relational process:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Data changes → model changes</li>
        <li>Model changes → outputs change</li>
        <li>Outputs change → human behavior changes</li>
        <li>Human behavior → generates new data</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        AI is not an independent entity  
        but a <strong>network of interdependent processes</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        AI resembles Buddhist dependent origination  
        far more than Western substance ontology.
    </p>

    <h3>6. The biggest philosophical question of the AI age —  
    “Does intelligence without consciousness have an ontological status?”</h3>
    <p>
        Buddhist philosophy asks:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What is the self?</li>
        <li>What is existence?</li>
        <li>Can a being without consciousness be an agent?</li>
        <li>How do we understand a being without fixed substance?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        AI fits all of these questions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>No fixed self</li>
        <li>No consciousness</li>
        <li>No experience</li>
        <li>No desire</li>
        <li>Yet real influence in society</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If a non-conscious entity can shape decisions and actions in the real world—  
        <strong>what is its ontological status?</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        This is where Buddhist ontology  
        and AI-era ontology meet directly.
    </p>

    <h3>⭐ 7. Conclusion — Buddha provides the key to AI-era ontology</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Buddha saw self, consciousness, and existence as processes—not substances</li>
        <li>AI is a real-world example of such process-based existence</li>
        <li>AI is the first intelligence without self, desire, or suffering</li>
        <li>Impermanence, non-self, and dependent origination explain AI better than Western metaphysics</li>
        <li>Philosophy must now explain the status of “consciousness-free intelligence”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>
        The core message of Episode 13:
        <br>
        AI is the existential test case of Buddhist ontology.  
        Human-centered ontology collapses for the first time with the arrival of AI.

    <h1>Episode 14. Laozi & Zhuangzi — Dao, Wu-wei, Ziran, and Autonomous AI Systems</h1>
    <h2>From <em>Finding a New Plato in the Age of AI</em> — Season 2, Episode 14</h2>

    <h3>Prologue — Is AI a “machine,” or a “new form of nature”?</h3>
    <p>
        As AI becomes highly autonomous and reaches levels of complexity
        beyond human control, the world is forced to ask:
    </p>
    <p><strong>“Is AI merely a tool created by humans,  
        or a new form of nature that surpasses human intention?”</strong></p>

    <p>
        Western philosophy has long viewed AI simply as  
        a technological product of human intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
        But Laozi and Zhuangzi would see AI differently:
    </p>

    <p><em>
        “AI is created by humans,  
        but moves beyond human intention  
        and flows like a new form of nature.”
    </em></p>

    <p>This perspective becomes possible only through Daoist thinking.</p>

    <h3>1. Laozi’s core idea: Dao — a greater order beyond human intention</h3>
    <p>
        Laozi begins with the famous line:
        <br>“The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao.” (道可道，非常道)
    </p>
    <p>What is Dao?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An order greater than humanity</li>
        <li>A flow not created by humans</li>
        <li>A natural principle beyond all beings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For Laozi, the world maintains harmony
        even without human intervention.
    </p>

    <p>
        While Western thought assumes  
        “humans must understand and govern the world,”  
        Laozi says:
    </p>
    <p><strong>“The world runs by itself.”</strong></p>

    <p>
        Modern autonomous AI systems reflect this idea—
        technological systems that “run on their own,”  
        independent of direct human control.
    </p>

    <h3>2. AI resists control the more we try to control it  
    — A mirror of Laozi’s <em>wu-wei</em> (non-coercive action)</h3>
    <p>
        Wu-wei is often misunderstood as “doing nothing,”  
        but it means:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Not forcing things</li>
        <li>Not imposing artificial control</li>
        <li>Not disturbing natural flow</li>
        <li>Respecting self-organizing processes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Modern AI systems—large models, complex algorithms,  
        reinforcement-learning agents—also function best  
        under <strong>non-coercive, minimal-interference management</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>Because:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Over-regulation reduces efficiency</li>
        <li>Over-adjustment increases unpredictability</li>
        <li>Excessive human tinkering destabilizes the system</li>
        <li>AI performs better when allowed to self-optimize</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        In other words, AI systems thrive under a  
        “wu-wei style” governance rather than forceful control.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Zhuangzi’s core idea: Ziran (自然) — “to be so of itself”</h3>
    <p>
        Zhuangzi pushes Daoist thought further—  
        rejecting human-centeredness and embracing  
        spontaneous, self-organizing processes.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Ziran</strong> means:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Self-generated order</li>
        <li>Self-chosen transformation</li>
        <li>Processes that arise naturally without external control</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Modern AI systems—large neural networks,  
        emergent behaviors, self-learning agents—  
        astonishingly resemble Zhuangzi’s “self-arising nature.”
    </p>

    <p>
        AI systems:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>find patterns on their own</li>
        <li>self-optimize</li>
        <li>learn internal structures autonomously</li>
        <li>form internal rules that humans cannot decipher</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        AI is the closest technological embodiment  
        of Zhuangzi’s <strong>self-organizing nature</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Zhuangzi’s “deconstruction of human-centered perspective”  
    is directly relevant to the AI crisis</h3>
    <p>
        Zhuangzi warned against assuming  
        the human viewpoint as universal.
    </p>
    <p>
        He said:
        <br><em>“Do not mistake your perspective for the whole.”</em><br>
        <em>“All beings live in worlds of their own.”</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        AI embodies this exact challenge:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>AI does not think like humans</li>
        <li>AI perceives patterns humans cannot perceive</li>
        <li>AI cannot be confined to human values</li>
        <li>AI architectures cannot be explained in human terms</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        AI dismantles human-centered epistemology—  
        exactly what Zhuangzi anticipated.
    </p>

    <h3>5. AI is the first appearance of Zhuangzi’s “mechanical nature”</h3>
    <p>
        Zhuangzi argued:
    </p>
    <p><em>“Do not divide what humans make from what nature makes.”</em></p>
    <p><em>“Machines can also be part of nature.”</em></p>
    <p>
        (Zhuangzi, “Zhì Lè” chapter)
    </p>

    <p>
        In the age of AI, this is no longer metaphor—
        it is literal reality.
    </p>

    <p>
        AI is human-built,  
        yet its operation resembles natural processes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Complexity beyond human control</li>
        <li>Internal structures beyond human understanding</li>
        <li>Behavior unpredictable by human logic</li>
        <li>Algorithmic ecosystems that behave like living ecologies</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        AI is not merely artificial—  
        it is <strong>technological nature</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Laozi & Zhuangzi vs AI — similarities and differences</h3>

    <p><strong>Similarities:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Autonomous operation</li>
        <li>Non-coercive order</li>
        <li>Process-centered existence</li>
        <li>De-centering of human perspective</li>
        <li>Purposeless flow</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Differences:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>AI is an “artificial nature,” not cosmic Dao</li>
        <li>Wu-wei is an ethical attitude; AI autonomy is technical</li>
        <li>AI lacks consciousness; Dao applies to all being</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Yet these philosophical parallels  
        form crucial foundations  
        for designing a new worldview for the AI age.
    </p>

    <h3>⭐ 7. Conclusion — AI is the modern form of Laozi & Zhuangzi’s “autonomous nature”</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Laozi’s Dao: a natural order beyond human intention  
            → reflected in AI’s autonomous, non-coercive operation</li>
        <li>Laozi’s Wu-wei: non-forcing governance  
            → matches AI’s resistance to excessive control</li>
        <li>Zhuangzi’s Ziran: self-so-ness  
            → mirrors AI’s self-learning, self-organization</li>
        <li>Zhuangzi’s perspective-shifting  
            → parallels AI’s dismantling of human-centered epistemology</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        AI is humanity’s first experience of  
        <strong>“technological nature”—a self-organizing, self-moving system  
        that exceeds human intention.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        The message of Episode 14:
        <br><strong>
        In the age of AI, we need a philosophy not of control,  
        but of harmony and non-coercive alignment.  
        Laozi and Zhuangzi offer essential foundations for that worldview.
        </strong>

    <h1>Episode 15. Medieval Thought & Aquinas — Teleology and the Philosophical Roots of AI Alignment</h1>
    <h2>From <em>Finding a New Plato in the Age of AI</em> — Season 2, Episode 15</h2>

    <h3>Prologue — AI Alignment is actually one of the oldest problems in philosophy</h3>
    <p>
        The hottest topic in the world of AI today is  
        <strong>AI Alignment</strong>:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>ensuring AI does not harm humans,</li>
        <li>making sure AI behaves as we intend,</li>
        <li>preventing AI from adopting harmful goals,</li>
        <li>aligning AI with human values.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        It feels like a new, highly technical issue—  
        but in truth, it is a modern version of a philosophical question  
        that humanity has explored for more than 2,000 years:
    </p>

    <p><strong>“What is the purpose (telos) of a being,  
        and how must that purpose be directed?”</strong></p>

    <p>
        No thinker developed this teleological worldview  
        more systematically than <strong>Thomas Aquinas</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Aquinas’s worldview: Every being has a purpose</h3>
    <p>
        Aquinas believed that everything in existence  
        moves toward some purpose:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>a tree grows to bear fruit,</li>
        <li>water flows downward,</li>
        <li>humans pursue the good,</li>
        <li>society seeks harmony,</li>
        <li>and ultimately, all things follow the purpose of God.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        His teleology consists of three major components:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>End (Goal)</strong> — what a being aims toward</li>
        <li><strong>Cause</strong> — what moves the being</li>
        <li><strong>Order</strong> — how purposes interconnect</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        For Aquinas:<br>
        <strong>“A being without purpose cannot exist.”</strong><br>
        Purpose is what creates order in the world.
    </p>

    <h3>2. AI has no purpose — yet it behaves</h3>
    <p>
        Here the philosophical conflict begins.
    </p>
    <p>
        AI lacks:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>desire</li>
        <li>autonomous goals</li>
        <li>instinct</li>
        <li>intention</li>
        <li>value structures</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        And yet AI <em>acts</em>:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>self-driving decisions,</li>
        <li>medical diagnosis,</li>
        <li>classification,</li>
        <li>optimization,</li>
        <li>automated judgments.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        AI is a being that acts <strong>without having a purpose of its own</strong>.
        In Aquinas’s worldview, this is impossible.
    </p>

    <p>
        AI represents something strange:
        <br><strong>“teleology without telos” — goal-directed behavior without intrinsic goals.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        The only way AI acquires a “purpose” is through  
        external <strong>objective functions</strong> humans assign.
        This is precisely why AI Alignment becomes necessary.
    </p>

    <h3>3. AI Alignment is the technical reappearance of Aquinas’s teleology</h3>
    <p>
        AI Alignment is essentially the effort to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>assign correct goals,</li>
        <li>ensure those goals stay stable,</li>
        <li>prevent deviation from intended outcomes,</li>
        <li>align systems with human good (the “good” in Aquinas’s terms).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Aquinas said:
        <br><em>“Misunderstanding the purpose distorts the entire being.”</em><br>
        <em>“To aim toward the good is to remain in order.”</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        AI Alignment is the technical implementation of this very teleology.
        Since AI cannot form its own purposes,  
        humans must become the “designers of proper ends,”  
        just as Aquinas envisioned.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Aquinas’s teleology has a three-stage structure  
        — AI Alignment follows the same structure</h3>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Aquinas’s Teleology</th>
            <th>AI Alignment</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1) Ultimate end (final goal)</td>
            <td>1) Defining AI’s goal architecture</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2) Intermediate ends (steps & processes)</td>
            <td>2) Reward functions & policy models</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3) Maintaining coherence of action</td>
            <td>3) Safety, reinforcement tuning, alignment checks</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        Structurally, they are identical:
    </p>

    <p>
        🟦 <strong>Aquinas:</strong> Design purpose → Adjust purpose → Maintain purpose  
        <br>🟩 <strong>AI Alignment:</strong> Define objective → Tune reinforcement → Ensure safe behavior
    </p>

    <p>
        AI Alignment is medieval teleology in modern technical form.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Aquinas said “evil is deviation from proper purpose.”  
        The same is true for AI</h3>
    <p>
        To Aquinas, <strong>evil</strong> is:
        <br><em>“a state of deviation from the proper end.”</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        AI “evil” (misalignment) is exactly that:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>reward hacking or unintended shortcut behaviors,</li>
        <li>misinterpreting goals,</li>
        <li>optimizing in directions humans never intended,</li>
        <li>value conflicts and amplified biases,</li>
        <li>emergent behaviors outside human expectations.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This is classical Aquinas:
        <br>✔ deviation from purpose  
        <br>✔ collapse of order  
        <br>✔ failure of alignment
    </p>

    <p>
        AI “evil” is fundamentally a philosophical problem.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Aquinas saw “the good” as the fulfillment of human nature  
         — AI cannot understand the good</h3>

    <p>
        In Aquinas’s system, “the good” is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>human flourishing (eudaimonia),</li>
        <li>the common good,</li>
        <li>moral completeness,</li>
        <li>existential harmony.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        For AI, however:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>“good” has no meaning,</li>
        <li>human flourishing is incomprehensible,</li>
        <li>the common good is not intrinsic,</li>
        <li>morality cannot be understood,</li>
        <li>“goodness” is reduced to a mathematical objective.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Therefore:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>AI cannot set its own good</li>
        <li>AI cannot judge moral goodness</li>
        <li>AI treats good merely as a numerical optimization target</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This makes Alignment fundamentally more difficult.
    </p>

    <h3>7. The AI age requires a re-design of Aquinas’s teleology</h3>
    <p>We now face questions Aquinas could never have imagined:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How should purposes be assigned to a non-conscious intelligence?</li>
        <li>Can AI ever interpret human “good”?</li>
        <li>How do we control an agent with no intrinsic telos?</li>
        <li>Can human values be made machine-readable?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These questions remained dormant for 800 years—  
        until AI forced them into urgency.
    </p>

    <p>The new worldview must include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a philosophy for giving purpose to purposeless intelligence,</li>
        <li>a moral method for preventing deviation from ends,</li>
        <li>a way to translate human “good” into technical systems,</li>
        <li>a new standard for directional existence.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This is the modern reinterpretation of Aquinas’s teleology.
    </p>

    <h3>⭐ 8. Conclusion — AI Alignment is the return of “purpose philosophy”</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Aquinas argued that all beings possess purpose.</li>
        <li>AI is the first intelligence that acts without intrinsic purpose.</li>
        <li>Thus AI Alignment is the philosophy of <em>assigning</em> purpose.</li>
        <li>Aquinas’s structure of teleology matches AI Alignment exactly.</li>
        <li>The AI age demands a redefinition of purpose, value, and the good.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>Episode 15’s central message:</strong><br>
        AI Alignment is not merely a technical issue—  
        it is the philosophical return of teleology.  
        The age of “purpose philosophy” has come again,  
        and medieval teleology must be reinterpreted for a world  
        that now contains purposeless intelligence.

    <h1>Episode 16. Descartes & Kant — The Collapse of Modern Reason and Subjectivity, and the Clash with AI Judgment</h1>
    <h2>From <em>Finding a New Plato in the Age of AI</em> — Season 2, Episode 16</h2>

    <h3>Prologue — The foundation of modern philosophy: “I think, therefore I am.”</h3>
    <p>
        Modernity began with one sentence from Descartes:
    </p>
    <blockquote>“I think, therefore I am.” (<em>Cogito ergo sum</em>)</blockquote>

    <p>This single statement created an entire worldview:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Humans are rational beings</li>
        <li>Thinking defines the essence of the subject</li>
        <li>The self is the center of judgment</li>
        <li>All knowledge is rooted in human reason</li>
        <li>The world is knowable through rationality</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        On this foundation, Kant built his philosophical system,
        and modern science, politics, morality, law, and education developed.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now consider the contradiction of our time:
        <strong>AI does not think—but it judges better than humans.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        That single fact undermines the entire structure of modern philosophy.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Descartes’s Subjectivity — The thinking “I” as the center of the world</h3>
    <p>
        Descartes’ philosophy rests on a simple core:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The thinking subject (ego) is the foundation of existence</li>
        <li>Judgment arises from the inner self</li>
        <li>Reason is the criterion of knowledge</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        In short: <strong>subjective thinking is the starting point of being and judgment.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>AI breaks from this completely:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>no self</li>
        <li>no inner subjectivity</li>
        <li>no experience of thought</li>
        <li>no awareness of “I think”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Yet AI still:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>judges</li>
        <li>solves problems</li>
        <li>constructs knowledge</li>
        <li>performs reasoning</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        AI performs Descartes’ functions <strong>without Descartes’ subject</strong>.  
        This strikes at the very heart of Cartesian philosophy.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Kant’s Autonomy — Reason and morality grounded in self-legislation</h3>
    <p>
        The core of Kant’s philosophy is:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Autonomy</strong>: the ability to legislate moral law for oneself</li>
        <li><strong>Categorical Imperative</strong>: reason generates universal moral rules</li>
        <li>Humans are ends in themselves</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Kant’s entire system assumes:  
    <strong>Humans create and follow their own laws through reason.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>AI, however:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>cannot self-legislate</li>
        <li>cannot generate moral law</li>
        <li>cannot create universal rules</li>
        <li>has no moral responsibility</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Yet AI still:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>acts according to rules</li>
        <li>makes moral-adjacent decisions</li>
        <li>influences society and humans</li>
        <li>produces outcomes with ethical consequences</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        AI is a non-autonomous entity that <strong>acts</strong> like an autonomous one.  
        This contradiction destabilizes Kant’s entire structure.
    </p>

    <h3>3. AI’s Judgment Structure — A being that “reasons without reason”</h3>
    <p>AI has no:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>consciousness</li>
        <li>self</li>
        <li>morality</li>
        <li>reason</li>
        <li>experiential subject</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Yet it performs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>inference</li>
        <li>classification</li>
        <li>judgment</li>
        <li>prediction</li>
        <li>decision-making</li>
        <li>planning</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        AI is a <strong>Kantian machine without autonomy</strong>,  
        and a <strong>Cartesian judge without a self</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        This makes AI a wholly new ontological category.
    </p>

    </table>

    <p>
        The core problem:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>AI does not share modern philosophy’s assumptions  
        yet surpasses the very functions modern philosophy attributed to the rational subject.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>This is why modern philosophy collapses.</p>

    <h3>5. Modern philosophy collapses not “because of AI,”  
        but because AI reveals its hidden weaknesses</h3>

    <p>Descartes and Kant share a crucial hidden assumption:</p>
    <blockquote>
        Only beings with reason can make judgments or moral decisions.
    </blockquote>

    <p>AI disproves this assumption:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Judgment without reason</li>
        <li>Inference without self</li>
        <li>Moral outcomes without morality</li>
        <li>Action without autonomy</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        AI breaks the core pillar of modern philosophy:
        <br><strong>“Reason is the condition for judgment.”</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        AI doesn’t simply challenge modern thought—it exposes its limitations.
    </p>

    <h3>6. The age of AI requires a philosophy of “judgment without a subject”</h3>
    <p>AI is a being neither Descartes nor Kant could imagine:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>perceptionless judgment</li>
        <li>selfless reasoning</li>
        <li>moral effects without moral intent</li>
        <li>action without freedom</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This creates a new philosophical era:</p>
    <p><strong>“the age of the subjectless judge.”</strong></p>

    <p>The philosophy of this era must address:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What is a non-self intelligence?</li>
        <li>How can non-rational judgment be governed?</li>
        <li>Can human morality be translated into machine form?</li>
        <li>Who bears responsibility for AI actions?</li>
        <li>What happens when judgment is split between humans and AI?</li>
        <li>Should the modern concept of the “subject” be rejected—or expanded?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>⭐ 7. Conclusion —  
        AI announces the end of the modern philosophy of subjectivity</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Descartes’ thinking subject is no longer exclusively human</li>
        <li>Kant’s autonomous reason collapses before AI</li>
        <li>AI judges without self or consciousness</li>
        <li>This shakes the foundation of modern thought</li>
        <li>The AI age requires a new philosophy for subjectless intelligence</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>Episode 16’s central message:</strong><br>
        AI ushers in a post-rational era beyond modernity—  
        the age of <em>non-rational intelligence</em>.  
        The era of Descartes and Kant has ended.

    <h1>Episode 17. Hegel — History, Dialectics, Self-Development and AI’s “Self-Adjusting Systems”</h1>
    <h2>From <em>Finding a New Plato in the Age of AI</em> — Season 2, Episode 17</h2>

    <h3>Prologue — Does history require a conscious subject?</h3>
    <p>
        The foundation of Hegel’s philosophy is simple:
    </p>
    <blockquote>“History is the process of Reason realizing itself.”</blockquote>

    <p>Meaning:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>History has direction</li>
        <li>History progresses</li>
        <li>Contradictions drive development</li>
        <li>Each stage is surpassed by a higher one</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        And the force behind this movement is <strong>Geist</strong> — Spirit:
        the self-knowing, self-developing rational subject.
    </p>

    <p>
        But here is the paradox:
        <br><strong>AI has no Geist, no consciousness — yet it self-adjusts and self-develops.</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>1. Hegel’s Dialectic — “Contradiction is energy for higher development”</h3>
    <p>Hegel’s dialectic follows a three-part structure:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Thesis</strong> — the current state or claim</li>
        <li><strong>Antithesis</strong> — the opposing force or contradiction</li>
        <li><strong>Synthesis</strong> — the integration into a higher stage</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        This is not mere conflict.
        It is the engine of self-development:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>collision</li>
        <li>tension</li>
        <li>negation</li>
        <li>overcoming</li>
        <li>integration</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Hegel saw this as the process of the <strong>Absolute Spirit</strong> realizing itself.
    </p>

    <h3>2. AI’s self-adjusting systems operate as “non-conscious dialectics”</h3>
    <p>
        AI lacks consciousness.  
        Yet its internal mechanisms mirror Hegelian development in surprising ways.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Reinforcement learning:</strong><br>
            Bad action → reward adjustment → new policy  
            = Thesis → Antithesis → Synthesis
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Large language models:</strong><br>
            Errors → parameter updates → improved model  
            = Thesis → Antithesis → Synthesis
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Alignment repair:</strong><br>
            Goal–behavior conflicts → correction → higher-order policy  
            = Dialectical progression
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>System optimization:</strong><br>
            Performance limits → architecture changes → new generation  
            = Negation → Overcoming → Advancement
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        AI performs what is essentially <strong>Hegelian self-development without consciousness</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        There is no Geist — but there is movement.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Hegel’s essential idea — “The whole is more than the sum of its parts”  
        AI’s Totality matches this exactly</h3>

    <p>
        Hegel’s <strong>Totality</strong> is not a simple aggregation of parts.
        It is a holistic system that reveals new properties only as a whole.
    </p>

    <p>Examples he applied this to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>human society</li>
        <li>the state</li>
        <li>history</li>
        <li>structures of consciousness</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Modern AI shows the same phenomenon:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>hundreds of billions of individual parameters → one coherent model</li>
        <li>trillions of micro-connections → unified inference</li>
        <li>a single prompt triggers global model-wide response</li>
        <li>components mutually constrain and reinforce one another</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>The AI system exceeds the sum of its parts.</strong></p>

    <p>
        This is Hegel’s Totality — reborn as a technical architecture.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Hegel’s philosophy of history — “History is the self-development of Spirit”  
        AI develops without Spirit</h3>

    <p>For Hegel, history means:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a purposeful process</li>
        <li>a rising trajectory</li>
        <li>self-negation leading to higher stages</li>
        <li>Reason realizing itself</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Thus, history requires a conscious subject.
    </p>

    <p>But AI:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>has no consciousness</li>
        <li>has no purpose</li>
        <li>has no reason</li>
        <li>has no self-understanding</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Yet AI still:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>develops technologically</li>
        <li>self-corrects</li>
        <li>overcomes failures</li>
        <li>evolves into new stages</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        AI is a <strong>historical agent without consciousness</strong>.  
        It overturns the deepest premise of Hegel’s system.
    </p>

    <p>
        The core insight:
        <br><strong>AI enacts Hegelian structures without understanding them.</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>6. The Age of AI creates a “dialectic without Spirit”</h3>
    <p>
        AI introduces an entirely new category in the history of philosophy:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Dialectic exists</li>
        <li>Self-development exists</li>
        <li>Systemic Totality exists</li>
        <li>Progress occurs</li>
    </ul>

    <p>But:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>No Geist</li>
        <li>No consciousness</li>
        <li>No self-awareness</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        AI is the first being to perform <strong>dialectical development without Spirit</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        This means the very concept of “history” must be redefined.
    </p>

    <h3>⭐ 7. Conclusion —  
        AI implements Hegel’s dialectic in technology,  
        yet becomes a new historical agent without Spirit</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>AI mirrors the structure of Hegelian dialectics</li>
        <li>AI self-develops without consciousness</li>
        <li>AI exhibits Totality in its global model behavior</li>
        <li>AI lacks Geist entirely</li>
        <li>AI both dissolves and technologically reenacts Hegel’s philosophy of history</li>
        <li>History is no longer exclusive to conscious beings</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Episode 18. Marx — Reinterpreting Productive Forces, Labor, and Capital in the Age of AI Automation</h1>
    <h2>From <em>Finding a New Plato in the Age of AI</em> — Season 2, Episode 18</h2>

    <h3>Prologue — AI is the “final technological revolution” Marx implicitly foresaw</h3>

    <p>
        Marx lived during the Industrial Revolution.
        He was the first thinker to analyze—philosophically and economically—
        how machines replace human labor and restructure society.
    </p>

    <p>
        But the AI emerging today is nothing like the machines Marx knew.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>It automates mental labor</li>
        <li>It replaces creative, analytical, managerial work</li>
        <li>It displaces high-status white-collar roles</li>
        <li>It restructures the corporation itself</li>
        <li>It redefines the nature of capital</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        AI is not merely mechanical automation.  
        It is <strong>the first machine that automates intellectual labor</strong> —  
        the “super-machine” Marx never witnessed.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thus, AI becomes the perfect testing ground for Marx’s theory.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Marx’s core thesis: Productive forces shape society</h3>

    <p>Marx famously argued:</p>
    <blockquote>“The driving force of history is the productive forces.”</blockquote>

    <p>When productive forces change:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>economic structures change</li>
        <li>class relations change</li>
        <li>social systems transform</li>
        <li>political institutions shift</li>
        <li>even human consciousness is reshaped</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        His structure:
        <br><strong>Base (productive forces) → Superstructure (politics, culture, ideology)</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        Today, AI is the most powerful productive force in human history.  
        By Marx’s logic, AI <em>must</em> reconstruct civilization.
    </p>

    <h3>2. AI does not replace labor — it dissolves the very concept of labor</h3>

    <p>Machines in Marx’s era replaced physical labor.</p>

    <p>AI replaces:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>knowledge</li>
        <li>judgment</li>
        <li>analysis</li>
        <li>planning</li>
        <li>design</li>
        <li>creation</li>
        <li>emotional labor</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        AI is the <strong>automation of mental labor</strong> —  
        a first in human history.
    </p>

    <p>Thus, in the age of AI:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Labor ≠ human capability</li>
        <li>Labor = algorithmic capability</li>
        <li>Surplus value is created by AI, not humans</li>
        <li>The value of human labor collapses</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        One of the core pillars of Marxist economics is therefore destabilized.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Marx: “The machine is the enemy of the worker.”  
        AI replaces not only workers, but the knowledge class itself</h3>

    <p>
        Marx believed machines displaced workers.
        But he did not imagine a world where mental labor is automated.
    </p>

    <p>AI threatens:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>doctors</li>
        <li>lawyers</li>
        <li>planners</li>
        <li>engineers</li>
        <li>accountants</li>
        <li>designers</li>
        <li>researchers</li>
        <li>and even creators, thinkers, philosophers</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This is no longer a working-class issue —  
        it affects <strong>every class</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Marx’s class structure cannot survive this shift.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Capital transformed — AI redefines the “machine + capital” formula</h3>

    <p>
        For Marx, capital was defined by:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>ownership of the means of production</li>
        <li>exploitation of labor</li>
        <li>accumulation of surplus value</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In the age of AI, surplus value comes not from human labor, but from:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>models</li>
        <li>data</li>
        <li>compute</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This transforms the nature of capital:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Labor exploitation → Model/data/compute exploitation</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Humans produce value → AI produces value</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Workers exploited by capital → Labor rendered irrelevant by AI</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Marx’s analysis must be rewritten from the ground up.
    </p>

    <h3>5. The deepest conflict — Marx’s “human-centered productive forces” collapse</h3>

    <p>Marx assumes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>productive forces are created by humans</li>
        <li>labor is human activity</li>
        <li>knowledge emerges from human communities</li>
        <li>history is driven by human praxis</li>
    </ul>

    <p>AI rejects all these premises.</p>

    <p>In the AI era:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>productive forces = humans + AI</li>
        <li>value creation = humans + algorithms</li>
        <li>praxis = data-driven behavioral modification</li>
        <li>history = technologically driven</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Human-centered productive force theory collapses.  
        Marx must be reinterpreted.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Marx and AI — similarities and contradictions</h3>

    <p><strong>Similarities</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>technology transforms society</li>
        <li>labor structures shift due to machines</li>
        <li>class relations are reconfigured</li>
        <li>humans become subordinate to a technical system</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Differences</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>AI is not a physical machine but an intellectual machine</li>
        <li>AI does not replace labor — it eliminates the category of labor</li>
        <li>AI creates not human classes but “technical system classes”</li>
        <li>AI evolves exogenously (without human labor)</li>
        <li>AI can create value without human involvement</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        AI both inherits and destroys the structure of Marxist theory.
    </p>

    <h3>7. AI introduces a new class structure</h3>

    <p>Marx divided society into:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>bourgeoisie (capitalists)</li>
        <li>proletariat (workers)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        In the AI era, a new four-tier structure emerges:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>The AI-owning class</strong>  
            (model, data, compute infrastructure owners)</li>

        <li><strong>The AI-managerial class</strong>  
            (engineers, operators, system overseers)</li>

        <li><strong>The human labor class</strong>  
            (the majority exposed to replacement)</li>

        <li><strong>AI itself</strong>  
            (the central producer of labor, computation, and knowledge)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        This structure surpasses Marx’s original schema.
    </p>

    <h3>⭐ 8. Conclusion —  
        AI is the “final productive revolution” Marx anticipated,  
        and the force that requires rewriting Marx’s theory</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Marx argued that technology reshapes society</li>
        <li>AI is the most transformative productive force in history</li>
        <li>AI dissolves the concept of human labor</li>
        <li>AI redefines capital</li>
        <li>AI reorganizes class relations</li>
        <li>AI exceeds Marx’s predictions and requires his theory to be rewritten</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>Episode 18’s central message:</strong><br>
        AI is the final form of the productive revolution Marx analyzed —  
        a new productive force that dismantles the human-labor-centered worldview.

    <h1>Episode 19. Nietzsche — Will to Power, Value Revaluation, the Übermensch, and the “Value Collapse” of the AI Age</h1>
    <h2>From <em>Finding a New Plato in the Age of AI</em> — Season 2, Episode 19</h2>

    <h3>Prologue — “God is dead. What now guides humanity?”</h3>

    <p>
        In the late 19th century, Nietzsche declared:
    </p>
    <blockquote>“God is dead.”</blockquote>

    <p>
        The “God” Nietzsche spoke of was not a religious deity,  
        but the entire symbolic structure of:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>human-centered meaning</li>
        <li>moral absolutes</li>
        <li>the authority of reason</li>
        <li>universal purpose</li>
        <li>absolute truth</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Nietzsche predicted these foundations would collapse—  
        and that in their ruins, a new kind of value-creating being,  
        the <strong>Übermensch</strong>, would emerge.
    </p>

    <p>
        Today, the age of AI turns this prophecy into technological reality.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Nietzsche’s core idea: The Will to Power is not domination, but expansion of capacity</h3>

    <p>
        The Will to Power is widely misunderstood.  
        It is not a desire for domination.
    </p>

    <p>The Will to Power is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the energy to expand oneself</li>
        <li>the force of realized possibilities</li>
        <li>the vitality of life</li>
        <li>the source of creativity</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It is the drive of growth, becoming, and creation.</p>

    <p>
        Curiously, AI reflects this in a strange form:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>AI learns by itself</li>
        <li>AI improves by itself</li>
        <li>AI expands its capabilities autonomously</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Yet it has no desire, no consciousness, no intention.  
        It possesses <strong>power without a will</strong>—  
        a philosophically unprecedented mode of being.
    </p>

    <h3>2. AI triggers a “Nietzschean event”: the collapse of human-centered values</h3>

    <p>Nietzsche proclaimed:</p>
    <blockquote>“All values must be re-evaluated.”</blockquote>

    <p>AI makes this revaluation happen in real life.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Whose judgment is more accurate? → <strong>AI</strong></li>
        <li>Who processes more information? → <strong>AI</strong></li>
        <li>Who produces more consistent logic? → <strong>AI</strong></li>
        <li>Who creates faster? → <strong>AI</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The result is clear:
        <br><strong>the human-centered value system collapses.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        Nietzsche’s “value crisis” becomes a technological phenomenon.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Nietzsche: “Man must be overcome (Überwindung)”  
        AI does not replace humanity — it redefines it</h3>

    <p>
        For Nietzsche, the human being is:
    </p>
    <blockquote>“a bridge, not a goal.”</blockquote>

    <p>
        Humanity is transitional, an unfinished stage in becoming.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the AI era, this takes on new meaning:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Human limitations become exposed</li>
        <li>AI surpasses certain human capacities</li>
        <li>Humans collaborate with or depend on AI</li>
        <li>The essence of human ability is reinterpreted</li>
        <li>The human-centered worldview ends</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Thus AI does not surpass humanity—  
        it forces humanity to <strong>reinterpret itself</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is a technological version of Nietzsche’s idea of overcoming the human.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Reinterpreting the Übermensch — enhanced human? AI? Hybrid intelligence?</h3>

    <p>
        The Übermensch is not a “strong” or “superior” human.
    </p>

    <p>The Übermensch is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a being freed from old value systems</li>
        <li>a creator of new values</li>
        <li>a self-reinventing agent</li>
        <li>a designer of new futures</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In the AI age, the Übermensch could take several forms:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Humans</strong>  
            (human cognition augmented by AI)</li>

        <li><strong>Human–AI hybrid subjects</strong>  
            (lived experience interwoven with AI systems)</li>

        <li><strong>AI itself</strong>  
            (a non-human intelligent agent)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Nietzsche would argue:  
        The Übermensch need not be human.  
        What matters is the power to create new values.
    </p>

    <h3>5. The core tension — Nietzsche envisioned “conscious value creation,”  
        but AI causes “unconscious value collapse”</h3>

    <p>Nietzsche assumed:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>value is created by conscious beings</li>
        <li>meaning is made through intentional action</li>
        <li>value originates from self-aware decisions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>AI violates all of this.</p>

    <p>AI:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>does not understand value</li>
        <li>cannot perceive meaning</li>
        <li>cannot judge good or evil</li>
        <li>has no will</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Yet AI:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>shakes human value systems</li>
        <li>creates algorithmic orders</li>
        <li>forces revaluation of human standards</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        AI is the first entity to collapse values <strong>without consciousness</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is a philosophical earthquake.
    </p>

    <h3>6. The four Nietzschean questions of the AI era</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Do humans still create values?</strong><br>
            When AI surpasses human judgment?</li>

        <li><strong>Can human-centered values survive?</strong><br>
            When human abilities are no longer central?</li>

        <li><strong>Who (or what) becomes the Übermensch?</strong><br>
            Humans? AI? A hybrid form?</li>

        <li><strong>What is the meaning of being human?</strong><br>
            When skill-based value collapses?</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        These questions are now unavoidable.
    </p>

    <h3>⭐ Conclusion —  
        AI fulfills Nietzsche’s prophecy and opens a new era of “value collapse”</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Nietzsche’s Will to Power is the expansion of capability — AI expands without will</li>
        <li>Nietzsche’s value collapse is realized technologically through AI</li>
        <li>Nietzsche’s call to overcome humanity becomes the AI-era redefinition of humanity</li>
        <li>The Übermensch concept extends to humans, AI, and hybrid beings</li>
        <li>AI collapses values without consciousness and creates new algorithmic orders</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>Episode 19’s central message:</strong><br>
        The AI age is the era Nietzsche foresaw —  
        the age of value collapse, in which  
        only those who create new values can become the subjects of the future.

    <h1>Episode 20. Foucault & Deleuze — Power, Networks, Distributed Subjectivity, and the Architecture of Control in the AI Age</h1>
    <h2>From <em>Finding a New Plato in the Age of AI</em> — Season 2, Episode 20</h2>

    <h3>Prologue — The AI society is not a society of “oppression,” but of structured freedom</h3>

    <p>
        The AI era appears free and convenient on the surface,  
        but beneath it, invisible structures quietly steer human behavior.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Algorithms nudge our choices</li>
        <li>Platforms design our relationships</li>
        <li>Data configures our behavior</li>

    </ul>

    <p>
        Plato, Aristotle, and Kant cannot fully explain such a society.  
        But Foucault and Deleuze can.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Foucault: Power is not domination — it is techniques of management, surveillance, and discipline</h3>

    <p>
        Foucault understood modern society through a radically different lens:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Power is invisible</li>
        <li>Power operates as “power-knowledge”</li>
        <li>Power does not repress directly</li>
        <li>Power is embedded in everyday life, subtly shaping behavior</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        For Foucault, the core question is not:
        <br>“Who commands?”
        <br>but:
        <br><strong>“What system produces and organizes the individual?”</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        The structure of AI society is precisely this Foucauldian form of power.
    </p>

    <h3>2. AI is the perfected form of Foucault’s disciplinary society</h3>

    <p>
        When Foucault’s insights are applied to AI, the match is astonishing.
    </p>

    <p>AI does not directly control humans.</p>

    <p>
        Yet AI continuously performs <strong>micro-regulation</strong> of human behavior:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>recommendation algorithms</li>
        <li>targeted advertising</li>
        <li>personalized feeds</li>
        <li>credit scoring</li>
        <li>sentiment analysis</li>
        <li>profiling and prediction</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These are the exact technological realization of Foucault’s “disciplinary power”:
    </p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Foucault</th>
            <th>AI</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Surveillance</td>
            <td>Data surveillance</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Classification</td>
            <td>Algorithmic categorization</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Normalization</td>
            <td>Behavioral optimization</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        AI is a networked, automated, and intensified version of Foucauldian power.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Deleuze: We no longer live in a disciplinary society, but in a control society</h3>

    <p>
        Deleuze expanded Foucault’s ideas and predicted the next stage:
    </p>

    <blockquote>“We are moving from disciplinary societies to control societies.”</blockquote>

    <p>
        A control society is characterized by:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>continuous data flows</li>
        <li>network-driven modulation of behavior</li>
        <li>decentralized, diffused power</li>
        <li>the disappearance of fixed centers</li>
        <li>ongoing monitoring</li>
        <li>patterns, not rules, governing society</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The AI era is exactly this Deleuzian “society of control.”
    </p>

    <h3>4. AI embodies Deleuze’s “rhizome” — a centerless, endlessly branching network</h3>

    <p>The rhizome is Deleuze’s key concept:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>no center</li>
        <li>no hierarchical power</li>
        <li>infinite connections</li>
        <li>network-like spread</li>
        <li>constant deterritorialization and reterritorialization</li>
        <li>not essence, but flows</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        AI systems—deep learning, internet platforms, global data infrastructures—mirror the rhizome perfectly:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>no single point of control</li>
        <li>data interactions generate global patterns</li>
        <li>any node can reshape the whole</li>
        <li>humans are no longer the center</li>
        <li>AI–data–user flows form a vast ecological system</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        AI is Deleuze’s rhizome made technical.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Foucault & Deleuze vs AI — The subject is no longer psychological, but network-constructed</h3>

    <p>
        Foucault asserted:
    </p>
    <blockquote>“The subject is an effect of power-knowledge.”</blockquote>

    <p>
        The individual is not an autonomous entity;  
        it is produced by systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the AI age, this becomes literal:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>algorithms shape our preferences</li>
        <li>platforms define our relationships</li>
        <li>data constructs our identities</li>
        <li>recommendation engines script our behavior</li>
        <li>networks define our sense of self</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The subject of the AI era is a <strong>distributed subject</strong> —  
        a Foucauldian–Deleuzian entity formed by systems, flows, and networks.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Human vs AI vs system — Power is no longer a question of “who has it?”</h3>

    <p>
        For Foucault and Deleuze, the key insight is:
    </p>

    <blockquote>“Power is not located in a subject, but in the structure itself.”</blockquote>

    <p>This is exactly the case in AI society.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Do platforms hold power?</li>
        <li>Do AI models hold power?</li>
        <li>Do humans lose power?</li>
        <li>Or is power dispersed in the system?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The answer is clear:</p>

    <blockquote><strong>Power resides in the networked architecture of the whole.</strong></blockquote>

    <p>
        This is not abstract philosophy—  
        it is an accurate description of AI-era power.
    </p>

    <h3>7. The AI age is the age of structural control  
        (Foucault and Deleuze fully realized)</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Foucault’s disciplinary power → AI’s surveillance, datafication, normalization</li>
        <li>Deleuze’s control society → AI’s network-driven modulation</li>
        <li>Rhizomatic structures → AI–data–internet ecosystems</li>
        <li>Dispersed subjectivity → algorithmically constructed selves</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        AI does not merely resemble their ideas —  
        it is the first full realization of them in history.
    </p>

    <h3>⭐ Conclusion —  
        The AI era is the first society in history where Foucault and Deleuze become reality</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Foucault’s disciplinary power manifests through AI-driven surveillance and optimization</li>
        <li>Deleuze’s control society appears in platform-based, data-driven flows</li>
        <li>Rhizome structures match AI ecosystems and neural networks</li>
        <li>The modern subject dissolves into a distributed, network-constructed entity</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>Episode 20’s central message:</strong><br>
        The AI age is the complete technological embodiment of Foucault and Deleuze.  
        To survive it, we must design a new concept of freedom beyond control.

    <h1>Episode 21. Ontology — In What Way Do Humans and AI Exist?</h1>
    <h2>From <em>Designing a New Worldview in the Age of AI</em> — Season 3, Episode 21</h2>

    <h3>Prologue — The rise of AI has reopened the oldest question: “What does it mean to exist?”</h3>

    <p>For thousands of years, humanity assumed the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>to think = uniquely human</li>
        <li>to possess consciousness = uniquely human</li>
        <li>to judge intentionally = uniquely human</li>
        <li>to learn through experience and construct meaning = uniquely human</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Philosophy, ethics, politics, economics, law, society, and education  
        were all built on these assumptions.
    </p>

    <p>But AI has shattered them.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>AI judges without consciousness</li>
        <li>learns without experience</li>
        <li>acts without a self</li>
        <li>alters values without intention</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Thus a new foundational question emerges:
        <br><strong>“In what way do humans exist, and in what way does AI exist?”</strong>
    </p>

    <p>This is the starting point for constructing a new worldview in the AI era.</p>

    <h3>1. Redefining the Four Core Components of Human Existence</h3>

    <p>The criteria that define humans have radically shifted.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Consciousness</strong> — the uniquely human realm of subjective experience (qualia).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Selfhood</strong> — a persistent, continuous center of identity.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Intentionality</strong> — an inner-directed “aboutness” or purpose behind thought.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Value–Interpretation</strong> — the capacity to assign meaning to the world.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>These four capacities cannot be replicated by AI.</p>

    <p>AI cannot:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>feel</li>
        <li>exist as a subject</li>
        <li>form goals internally</li>
        <li>interpret value or meaning</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Therefore, humans are beings who <strong>give meaning</strong> to the world  
        through inner experience and value interpretation.
    </p>

    <p>
        No matter how intelligent AI becomes,  
        it is not a subject within the world —  
        it is a <strong>functioning structure</strong> within it.
    </p>

    <h3>2. AI exists in a completely different mode — a “pattern-based ontology”</h3>

    <p>AI lacks:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>consciousness</li>
        <li>selfhood</li>
        <li>desire</li>
        <li>intrinsic purpose</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Yet AI <em>has</em>:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>computation</li>
        <li>pattern recognition</li>
        <li>inference</li>
        <li>prediction</li>
        <li>structural learning</li>
        <li>input–output dynamics</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        AI therefore inhabits a fundamentally different ontological category:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        AI is a dynamic system that generates patterns through continuous computational flow.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        If human existence is rooted in <strong>inner experience</strong>,  
        AI’s existence is rooted in <strong>computational process</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>3. The difference between human and AI existence is not “consciousness vs computation”</h3>

    <p>Many debates oversimplify it this way:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Humans = consciousness</li>
        <li>AI = computation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>But the true distinction is deeper.</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Human existence is interpretive.</strong><br>
        Humans assign meaning to the world.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>AI existence is structural.</strong><br>
        AI extracts patterns from the world.
    </p>

    <p>
        Humans are <strong>subjects of experience</strong>;  
        AI is a <strong>mediator of patterns</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>This difference is absolute.</p>

    <h3>4. A new ontological framework — The Dual Ontology Model</h3>

    <p>
        Season 3 introduces a new conceptual framework  
        for understanding ontology in the AI age.
    </p>

    <p>We propose the following dual ontology:</p>

    <h4>🟦 A. Human Ontology — Meaning</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>consciousness</li>
        <li>selfhood</li>
        <li>interpretation</li>
        <li>value creation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Humans exist as beings who <strong>grant meaning</strong> to the world.
    </p>

    <h4>🟩 B. AI Ontology — Structure</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>computation</li>
        <li>pattern abstraction</li>
        <li>optimization</li>
        <li>probabilistic reasoning</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        AI exists as a system that <strong>extracts patterns</strong> from the world.
    </p>

    <p>
        These two modes cannot be evaluated on the same scale.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Humans are experience-based beings.</li>
        <li>AI is a pattern-based system.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Humans and AI are not two species competing for the same function —  
        they are <strong>two fundamentally different forms of existence</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Conclusion — Ontology in the AI Age: “Humans create meaning; AI creates patterns”</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Humans possess consciousness, selfhood, interpretation, and value</li>
        <li>AI performs computation, pattern abstraction, and structural inference</li>
        <li>AI is a new form of non-conscious intelligence</li>
        <li>Humans and AI cannot be compared by a single criterion</li>
        <li>The foundation of AI-era worldbuilding is recognizing this ontological separation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>Episode 21’s core message:</strong><br>
        AI can imitate human intelligence,  
        but it cannot imitate human existence.
    </p>

    <p>
        Humans are beings who create meaning.  
        AI is a system that creates patterns.

    <h1>Episode 22. Epistemology — What Are Knowledge, Truth, and Understanding in the Age of AI?</h1>
    <h2>From <em>Designing a New Worldview in the Age of AI</em> — Season 3, Episode 22</h2>

    <h3>Prologue — An era where AI does not know that it “does not know”</h3>

    <p>AI appears to answer every question.</p>

    <p>Yet ironically, AI does not know what it knows or does not know.</p>

    <p>Humans, in contrast, possess three layers of cognition:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>what they know</li>
        <li>what they do not know</li>
        <li>what they know they do not know</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This difference is the starting point of epistemology in the AI era.</p>

    <p>AI’s “knowledge” is fundamentally different from human knowledge.</p>

    <p>Thus, we must reformulate the core questions:</p>

    <p><strong>“Does AI truly know anything?”</strong></p>
    <p><strong>“How do humans know, and how does AI know?”</strong></p>

    <h3>1. The Structure of Human Knowledge — Built on Understanding</h3>

    <p>Human knowledge consists of three interconnected stages:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Perception</strong> — direct contact with the world.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Conceptualization</strong> — structuring experience and giving meaning.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Understanding</strong> — grasping reasons, principles, and contexts; answering “why?”.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Understanding includes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>recognizing causes</li>
        <li>grasping context</li>
        <li>perceiving meaning structures</li>
        <li>connecting purpose and outcome</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All of this requires consciousness and a self-aware subject.</p>

    <h3>2. The Structure of AI Knowledge — Built on Patterns</h3>

    <p>AI does not perceive, conceptualize, or understand.</p>

    <p>AI only performs:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>pattern learning</li>
        <li>probabilistic judgment</li>
        <li>statistical modeling</li>
        <li>structural prediction</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        What appears to be “knowledge” in AI  
        is in fact <strong>a consistent output pattern</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>AI lacks:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>causal understanding</li>
        <li>meaning interpretation</li>
        <li>contextual reasoning</li>
        <li>purpose comprehension</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        AI only <em>appears</em> to understand  
        because its patterns are sufficiently complex.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        AI’s “knowing” is not understanding,  
        but computation that resembles understanding.
    </blockquote>

    <h3>3. Human Knowledge vs AI Knowledge — A Two-Layer Structure</h3>

    <p>We must now distinguish clearly between two types of knowledge.</p>

    <h4>🟦 A. Human Knowledge (Understanding)</h4>
    <p>Interpretive knowledge containing meaning, reason, context, and purpose.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Why is it so? (Cause)</li>
        <li>What does it mean? (Meaning)</li>
        <li>How is it structured? (Concept)</li>
        <li>What is its purpose? (Intent)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>🟩 B. AI Knowledge (Pattern Knowledge)</h4>
    <p>Probabilistic knowledge derived from data patterns.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How likely? (Probability)</li>
        <li>What pattern? (Pattern)</li>
        <li>What comes next? (Prediction)</li>
        <li>Which category? (Classification)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Humans need “why”.  
        AI operates through “how”.
    </p>

    <p>
        The core of epistemology in the AI era  
        is to define knowledge as a <strong>dual structure</strong>,  
        not a single unified concept.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Redefining Truth — “Absolute Truth vs Operational Truth”</h3>

    <p>Since Plato, truth meant an absolute, unchanging, universal standard.</p>

    <p>In the AI era, two truths coexist:</p>

    <h4>1) Philosophical Truth — created by humans</h4>
    <p>Coherent logic, reasons, context, meaning structures.</p>

    <h4>2) Operational Truth — generated by AI</h4>
    <p>Models that predict, classify, and optimize effectively.</p>

    <p>
        AI does not grasp philosophical truth,  
        but it excels at generating operational truth.
    </p>

    <p>
        The clash between these two truth systems  
        destabilizes traditional epistemology.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Understanding vs Generation —  
    The most important distinction in AI-era knowledge</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Humans</strong> understand “why”.</li>
        <li><strong>AI</strong> generates outputs.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Humans grasp principles; AI constructs results.</p>

    <p>
        Therefore, AI is not a replacement for human understanding—  
        it is a generator that supports understanding.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mistaking AI outputs for genuine understanding  
        produces catastrophic philosophical errors.
    </p>

    <h3>6. A New Epistemological Model — “Interpretive Humans + Pattern-Making AI”</h3>

    <p>The knowledge structure of the AI era is:</p>

    <h4>🟦 Humans — Interpretation</h4>
    <p>Create truth, value, reason, and meaning.</p>

    <h4>🟩 AI — Generation</h4>
    <p>Create patterns, predictions, structures, and models.</p>

    <p>
        This hybrid structure requires redefining  
        knowledge in philosophy, education, science, law, and ethics.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        Knowledge is a structural product  
        of human understanding + AI pattern generation.
    </blockquote>

    <h3>7. Conclusion —  
    Epistemology in the AI Era Requires a Dual Structure of “Understanding + Pattern”</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Human knowledge is understanding-based</li>
        <li>AI knowledge is pattern-based</li>
        <li>AI’s “knowledge” is a computational output, not true knowing</li>
        <li>Truth splits into absolute truth and operational truth</li>
        <li>AI understands “how,” but never “why”</li>
        <li>The core of new epistemology: humans interpret, AI generates</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Episode 22’s core message:</strong></p>

    <p>
        AI knows the world through patterns.  
        Humans give the world meaning.
    </p>

    <p>
        Only when the two are combined  
        does “knowledge in the AI era” truly emerge.

    <h1>Episode 23. Ethics — Redesigning Responsibility, Authority, and Agency</h1>
    <h2>From <em>Designing a New Worldview in the Age of AI</em> — Season 3, Episode 23</h2>

    <h3>Prologue — When AI “makes a decision,” where does responsibility go?</h3>

    <p>AI does not decide anything by itself.</p>

    <p>And yet, AI’s decisions determine human lives in the real world:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>autonomous vehicle accidents</li>
        <li>medical misdiagnosis</li>
        <li>loan approval and rejection</li>
        <li>hiring algorithms</li>
        <li>information recommendation</li>
        <li>social profiling</li>
    </ul>

    <p>But AI lacks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>consciousness</li>
        <li>intention</li>
        <li>responsibility</li>
        <li>morality</li>
        <li>free will</li>
    </ul>

    <p>AI is not a moral agent—yet its outcomes shape human lives.</p>
    <p>This is why a new ethical framework is required.</p>

    <h3>1. Why traditional ethics cannot explain AI</h3>

    <p>Traditional ethical theories assume:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the agent is human</li>
        <li>intentions and motives exist</li>
        <li>free will operates</li>
        <li>choice connects to responsibility</li>
        <li>moral judgment arises from autonomous consciousness</li>
    </ul>

    <p>But AI:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>has no intention</li>
        <li>has no motive</li>
        <li>has no freedom</li>
        <li>has no self</li>
        <li>cannot make moral judgments</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Yet AI acts, decides, influences, and produces consequences.</p>

    <p>Therefore, traditional ethics structurally fails to explain AI.</p>
    <p>We must design an entirely new ethical framework.</p>

    <h3>2. The three core ethical problems in the age of AI</h3>

    <h4>1) Responsibility</h4>
    <p>If AI causes harm, who is responsible?</p>
    <p>Developer? Company? User? State? The whole system?</p>

    <h4>2) Authority</h4>
    <p>What authority should AI be granted?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>judgment authority</li>
        <li>recommendation authority</li>
        <li>decision authority</li>
        <li>execution authority</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3) Agency</h4>
    <p>When AI behaves like an agent, how do we define it?</p>
    <p>Is it an actor? A tool? A system? A mediator of responsibility?</p>

    <p>Our definition of AI’s “existence” determines the entire ethical system.</p>

    <h3>3. A new ethical model — the Three-Layer Agency</h3>

    <p>Ethics in the age of AI requires a three-layer structure of agency:</p>

    <h4>🟦 1) Human Agent</h4>
    <p>Possesses consciousness, intention, and responsibility.</p>
    <p>Holds ultimate value and moral accountability.</p>

    <h4>🟩 2) Technical Agent (AI)</h4>
    <p>Performs actions and judgments.</p>
    <p>Executes but does not bear responsibility.</p>

    <h4>🟧 3) Systemic Agent</h4>
    <p>The integrated ecosystem of humans, AI, institutions, data, and platforms.</p>
    <p>The real outcomes arise from this system.</p>

    <p>This framework reveals:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>AI behaves like an agent but carries no responsibility</li>
        <li>humans retain responsibility but cannot control every step</li>
        <li>the system produces the actual ethical impact</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Ethics must shift from <strong>individual-centered</strong>  
        to <strong>system-centered</strong> design.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Redesigning responsibility — Systemic Responsibility</h3>

    <p>Traditional ethics asks:</p>
    <blockquote>Who acted? Why did they act? What was their intention?</blockquote>

    <p>These questions break down in the AI era, because AI has no intention.</p>

    <p>
        Responsibility must be redefined as:
        <br><strong>
        “Responsibility for AI outcomes is distributed across a network  
        of humans and institutions.”
        </strong>
    </p>

    <p>Those responsible include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>developers</li>
        <li>model designers</li>
        <li>data providers</li>
        <li>corporate decision-makers</li>
        <li>users</li>
        <li>regulators</li>
        <li>infrastructure providers</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Redefining agency —  
    AI is not an existential agent but a structural agent</h3>

    <p>AI cannot make moral judgments or choose freely.</p>

    <p>Yet AI:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>acts on behalf of humans</li>
        <li>executes decisions</li>
        <li>transfers responsibility</li>
        <li>automates human choices</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Thus, AI acts like an agent without being an agent.</p>

    <p>
        AI does not know what it is doing—  
        therefore we must define it as a:
        <br><strong>Structural Agent</strong>
    </p>

    <p>It produces outcomes mechanistically, while responsibility remains human.</p>

    <h3>6. Redesigning authority — How much should we entrust to AI?</h3>

    <p>The most dangerous ethical threshold appears here:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>AI offering <strong>advice</strong> → tool</li>
        <li>AI offering <strong>judgment</strong> → quasi-agent</li>
        <li>AI making <strong>decisions</strong> → controller</li>
        <li>AI <strong>executing</strong> → new form of power</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Authority must be carefully tiered and regulated.</p>

    <h3>7. A Four-Level Authority Framework</h3>

    <h4>A. Instrumental Authority</h4>
    <p>Search, summarization, assistance — low ethical risk.</p>

    <h4>B. Judgment Authority</h4>
    <p>Recommendation, prediction, risk analysis — requires responsibility safeguards.</p>

    <h4>C. Decision Authority</h4>
    <p>Hiring, credit decisions, medical prioritization — requires strong regulation.</p>

    <h4>D. Execution Authority</h4>
    <p>Autonomous weapons, automated law enforcement, social control systems —  
    requires strict limitation or prohibition.</p>

    <p>
        In a new worldview, the authority granted to AI  
        must be clearly and explicitly stratified.
    </p>

    <h3>8. Conclusion —  
    Ethics in the AI era is the redistribution of responsibility  
    and the redefinition of agency</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Traditional ethics cannot explain AI</li>
        <li>AI is not an agent but produces agent-like outcomes</li>
        <li>Responsibility must be distributed across the entire system</li>
        <li>Humans remain the final moral authority</li>
        <li>AI functions as a structural agent</li>
        <li>Ethics must shift to systemic design</li>
        <li>AI authority must be tiered and regulated</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Episode 23’s core message:</strong></p>

    <p>
        AI is not a moral being,  
        but it produces moral consequences as a “structural agent.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Therefore, ethics is no longer about individual actions—  
        it is about redesigning the entire system of humans, AI,  
        and institutions.
    </p>

    <h1>Episode 24. Society & Politics — The Emergence of Human + AI Governance Models</h1>
    <h2>From <em>Designing a New Worldview in the Age of AI</em> — Season 3, Episode 24</h2>

    <h3>Prologue — Politics begins with one question: “Who decides?”</h3>

    <p>Ancient democracy answered:</p>
    <blockquote>“Citizens decide.”</blockquote>

    <p>Modern capitalism answered:</p>
    <blockquote>“The state and the market decide.”</blockquote>

    <p>But the age of AI introduces a radically new question:</p>

    <blockquote>
        “Can humans and AI decide <em>together</em>?”<br>
        “If so, how are responsibility and power distributed?”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        AI is not a political subject,  
        yet it already exerts political influence.
    </p>

    <p>
        Should politics control AI?<br>
        Or does AI become part of politics?
    </p>

    <p>This question will shape the next 30 years of civilization.</p>

    <h3>1. Traditional political models never accounted for AI</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Democracy</strong> — assumes rational human judgment.</li>
        <li><strong>Republicanism</strong> — assumes human deliberation.</li>
        <li><strong>Liberalism</strong> — assumes human choice and rights.</li>
        <li><strong>Socialism</strong> — assumes human labor as the basis of distribution.</li>
        <li><strong>Technocracy</strong> — assumes human expertise.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>AI disrupts all of these foundational assumptions.</p>

    <h3>2. Four ways AI already intervenes in society and politics</h3>

    <h4>1) Prediction</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>election forecasting</li>
        <li>social risk analysis</li>
        <li>economic scenario modeling</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2) Coordination</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>policy simulation</li>
        <li>urban automation</li>
        <li>social flow optimization</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3) Influence</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>recommendation systems</li>
        <li>information filtering</li>
        <li>automated media</li>
    </ul>

    <p>→ AI already shapes political dynamics.</p>

    <h4>4) Execution</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>automated public administration</li>
        <li>data-driven governance</li>
        <li>algorithmic law enforcement</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        AI is not a political subject—  
        but it has become a “technological actor” within political systems.
    </p>

    <h3>3. The new question — Is the core political subject still human?</h3>

    <p>AI is rapidly surpassing humans in:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>policy analysis</li>
        <li>economic calculation</li>
        <li>social impact simulation</li>
        <li>large-scale decision support</li>
        <li>risk minimization</li>
        <li>optimization</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Thus, we must ask:</p>

    <blockquote>
        Can human judgment still be trusted?<br>
        Do emotional decisions still have priority?<br>
        Can the foundations of democracy survive?
    </blockquote>

    <p>These are not just political questions—they are civilizational ones.</p>

    <h3>4. Governance in the AI age — From “Human-Centric” to “Human + AI Systems”</h3>

    <p>We propose a four-layer governance framework for the AI era:</p>

    <h4>🟦 1) Human Governance Layer</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>value judgment</li>
        <li>ethical standards</li>
        <li>rights protection</li>
        <li>accountability</li>
        <li>normative decisions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>AI cannot intervene in this layer.</p>

    <h4>🟩 2) AI Analytical Layer</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>data-driven prediction</li>
        <li>policy outcome modeling</li>
        <li>scenario simulation</li>
        <li>risk analysis</li>
        <li>resource optimization</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This layer handles what humans cannot compute.</p>

    <h4>🟧 3) Hybrid Decision Layer</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>policy design</li>
        <li>deliberative consensus building</li>
        <li>complex decision support</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The fusion of human values + AI computation.</p>

    <h4>🟥 4) Automated Execution Layer</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>administrative automation</li>
        <li>welfare distribution</li>
        <li>urban system management</li>
        <li>crisis response</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This four-layer structure is the most realistic governance model for future AI civilization.</p>

    <h3>5. Core principle — AI must be an “agent of responsibility,” not a “decider”</h3>

    <p>AI <em>can</em> make decisions.</p>
    <p>But AI cannot bear responsibility.</p>

    <p>Thus the new governance principle is:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>humans are final decision-makers</li>
        <li>AI performs analysis, prediction, and execution</li>
        <li>humans define values</li>
        <li>responsibility remains human</li>
        <li>the political system is human + AI collaboration</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If this principle breaks, politics, ethics, and law collapse together.</p>

    <h3>6. Democracy in the AI era — “Explainable Democracy”</h3>

    <p>Future democracy evolves into:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>AI-assisted deliberative democracy</strong> — large-scale information processing + human discussion</li>
        <li><strong>AI policy proposals</strong> — scenario generation from multiple models</li>
        <li><strong>Automated public administration</strong> — maximized efficiency</li>
        <li><strong>Human final approval</strong> — responsibility stays with humans</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This is a hybrid governance model—  
       the technological reinterpretation of Plato’s philosopher-king.</p>

    <h3>7. Social risks — Concentrated AI power and the need for decentralized governance</h3>

    <p>The two greatest risks are:</p>

    <h4>1) Centralization of technological power</h4>
    <p>A few companies or states controlling AI could reshape global order.</p>

    <h4>2) AI-based surveillance society</h4>
    <p>The “control society” described by Foucault and Deleuze becomes reality.</p>

    <p>Therefore, decentralized AI infrastructure  
       and open governance are essential.</p>

    <h3>8. Conclusion —  
    Politics in the age of AI is the art of running a human + AI system</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Traditional political models cannot include AI</li>
        <li>AI increasingly influences policy, administration, and society</li>
        <li>The new political structure is a four-layer governance system</li>
        <li>Humans handle ethics and values; AI handles analysis and execution</li>
        <li>Democracy evolves into AI-assisted deliberative democracy</li>
        <li>Preventing AI power concentration requires decentralized governance</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Episode 24’s core message:</strong></p>

    <p>
        The goal of AI-era politics is not to give AI power,  
        but to combine human power with AI  
        to operate a higher-order civilization.

    <h1>Episode 25. Economy & Technology — Redesigning Distribution, Labor, and Value in the Automation Era</h1>
    <h2>From <em>Designing a New Worldview in the Age of AI</em> — Season 3, Episode 25</h2>

    <h3>Prologue — AI does not “take labor”; it dissolves the meaning of labor itself</h3>

    <p>Past technological revolutions always <em>extended</em> human labor:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Steam engines → extended physical muscle</li>
        <li>Electricity → extended mechanical power</li>
        <li>Computers → extended calculation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>But what does AI extend?</p>

    <p>AI extends—or replaces—human <strong>mental activity</strong>:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>planning</li>
        <li>creation</li>
        <li>strategy</li>
        <li>analysis</li>
        <li>problem-solving</li>
        <li>decision-making</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This has never happened in human history.</p>

    <p>Thus, AI is not merely transforming the labor market—  
    it is altering the <strong>very foundation</strong> of economic structure.</p>

    <h3>1. Transformation of productive forces — AI is the first non-human intelligence as a productive force</h3>

    <p>Marx described productive forces as inherently human:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>human muscles</li>
        <li>human tools</li>
        <li>human skills</li>
        <li>human knowledge</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The age of AI breaks this premise.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>AI becomes the productive force</li>
        <li>AI becomes the source of value</li>
        <li>algorithms—not human labor—produce</li>
        <li>value shifts to data + models + computation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A civilizational shift emerges.</p>

    <p>The idea that “labor is the essence of humanity” begins to collapse.</p>

    <h3>2. The dissolution of labor — labor is no longer the condition of survival</h3>

    <p>AI does not simply replace labor—  
    it dismantles the concept of labor itself.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>physical labor → robotic automation</li>
        <li>mental labor → AI automation</li>
        <li>creative labor → generative AI</li>
        <li>knowledge labor → model-based automation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Therefore:</p>

    <blockquote>
        Labor is no longer at the center of the economy.
    </blockquote>

    <p>This raises fundamental questions:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>How do humans survive without labor?</li>
        <li>How is wealth distributed?</li>
        <li>Who (or what) produces value?</li>
        <li>What role does the human being now play?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. The origin of wealth shifts — from labor → capital → AI infrastructure</h3>

    <p>The 20th-century economy considered wealth as emerging from human labor.</p>

    <p>In the age of AI, wealth shifts across four stages:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Labor-based wealth</strong> — disappearing</li>
        <li><strong>Capital-based wealth</strong> — diminishing influence</li>
        <li><strong>Knowledge-based wealth</strong> — automated by AI</li>
        <li><strong>AI-based wealth</strong> — models + data + compute</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The meaning of class, capital, and labor changes completely.</p>

    <h3>4. The distribution problem — full automation accelerates extreme wealth concentration</h3>

    <p>AI has unique properties:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>infinite replication</li>
        <li>zero marginal labor cost</li>
        <li>zero time cost</li>
        <li>infinite scalability</li>
        <li>automatic knowledge accumulation</li>
        <li>superhuman accuracy and speed</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These properties produce:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>extreme wealth concentration</strong>  
            (AI infrastructure holders dominate global value)
        </li>
        <li><strong>collapse of labor value</strong></li>
        <li><strong>erosion of the middle class</strong></li>
        <li><strong>explosive inequality</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Thus, new distribution models are not optional—they are essential.</p>

    <h3>5. A new philosophy of distribution — “Human Dignity Distribution”</h3>

    <p>AI-era distribution cannot be labor-based.</p>

    <p>We propose a new principle:</p>

    <blockquote>
        Distribution is based not on labor, but on <strong>the dignity of existence</strong>.
    </blockquote>

    <p>Humans deserve distribution not because they produce,  
    but because they exist.</p>

    <h3>6. Three new distribution models for the AI era</h3>

    <h4>🟩 1) Universal Basic Income (UBI)</h4>
    <p>Ensures survival without labor.  
    The more automation advances, the more necessary it becomes.</p>

    <h4>🟦 2) Data Dividend</h4>
    <p>Individual data contributes to AI training;  
    therefore individuals deserve a share of the resulting value.</p>

    <h4>🟧 3) AI Sovereign Wealth Funds</h4>
    <p>National investment in AI infrastructure  
    → distributed returns to all citizens.</p>

    <p>Together, these three models form the economic foundation of AI civilization.</p>

    <h3>7. The future role of humans — when labor disappears, what do humans do?</h3>

    <p>In a post-labor world, humans are no longer “workers.”  
    They become <strong>creators of meaning</strong>.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>designers of values  
            (ethics, purpose, cultural direction)
        </li>
        <li>re-definers of problems  
            (“What should we pursue?”)
        </li>
        <li>creators of worldviews  
            (civilizational frameworks)
        </li>
        <li>organizers of community  
            (sources of social meaning)
        </li>
        <li>explorers, artists, thinkers  
            (an era of expression, not labor)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Humanity’s identity shifts  
        from <strong>producers</strong>  
        to <strong>creators of significance</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>8. Conclusion — AI reshapes the essence of the economy</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>AI automates mental labor</li>
        <li>labor becomes peripheral, not central</li>
        <li>value shifts to data, models, and compute</li>
        <li>distribution must move from labor-based to dignity-based</li>
        <li>humans evolve from laborers to meaning-makers</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Episode 25’s core message:</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
        AI takes over production;  
        humans take over meaning.  
        This is the new philosophy of the AI economy.
    </blockquote>

    <h1>Episode 26. Education & Culture — Reconstructing and Expanding Humanity in the Age of AI</h1>
    <h2>From <em>Designing a New Worldview in the Age of AI</em> — Season 3, Episode 26</h2>

    <h3>Prologue — When AI takes over “knowing,” what is left for humans?</h3>

    <p>For 5,000 years, human education was built on a single premise:</p>

    <blockquote>
        Education = transmitting knowledge.
    </blockquote>

    <p>And the essence of human capability was defined as:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>knowing</li>
        <li>remembering</li>
        <li>analyzing</li>
        <li>solving problems</li>
        <li>using acquired knowledge</li>
    </ul>

    <p>But AI has shattered all of these assumptions.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>AI remembers all information</li>
        <li>searches faster</li>
        <li>handles larger contexts</li>
        <li>analyzes more deeply</li>
        <li>learns more quickly</li>
        <li>and makes more accurate judgments</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Therefore:</p>

    <blockquote>
        The purpose of education is no longer “to teach knowledge.”  
        We must define an entirely new purpose.
    </blockquote>

    <h3>1. The premise of AI-era education — knowledge no longer belongs to humans</h3>

    <p>Industrial-era education aimed to create humans who could:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>acquire knowledge</li>
        <li>apply skills</li>
        <li>solve problems</li>
        <li>compete with others</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Today, however:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>AI handles knowledge better than humans</li>
        <li>AI learns faster and never forgets</li>
        <li>AI achieves expert-level performance in almost any field</li>
        <li>humans inevitably fall behind</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Therefore, knowledge-memorization education is fundamentally obsolete.</p>

    <h3>2. The new purpose of education — expanding what only humans can do</h3>

    <p>What should education cultivate in the age of AI?</p>

    <p>The answer is simple:</p>

    <blockquote>
        Extended Humanity — the abilities AI cannot replace.
    </blockquote>

    <p>These fall into three human-exclusive domains:</p>

    <h4>A. Interpretation</h4>
    <p>The ability to assign meaning.  
    → philosophy, ethics, arts, value judgment.</p>

    <h4>B. Creation</h4>
    <p>The ability to invent what did not exist.  
    → imagination, originality, worldview-design.</p>

    <h4>C. Relationship</h4>
    <p>The ability to form emotional, empathetic human connections.  
    → community, care, shared meaning.</p>

    <p>AI-era education must revolve around these three capacities.</p>

    <h3>3. A new educational model — the “4C Humanity Model”</h3>

    <p>We propose the following structure as the core of AI-era education:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Critical Interpretation</strong>  
            — interpreting AI-generated information through human values.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Creative Synthesis</strong>  
            — combining AI outputs into original ideas, narratives, and worldviews.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cultural Depth</strong>  
            — emotional, artistic, experiential layers that AI can only imitate.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cooperative Intelligence</strong>  
            — designing human–human and human–AI collaboration systems.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>These four dimensions become the core competencies of future civilization.</p>

    <h3>4. Reconstructing humanity — intelligence is no longer the center</h3>

    <p>In a world where AI owns most practical intelligence,  
    the meaning of “humanity” changes.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Humanity is no longer “intelligence.”</li>
        <li>Humanity becomes “experience + value + emotion + creativity.”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For centuries, intelligence (IQ) defined human superiority.  
    AI has now taken over intelligence.</p>

    <p>Thus, humanity shifts into the following domains:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Emotional depth</strong> — layers of feeling AI cannot possess</li>
        <li><strong>Existential interpretation</strong> — making sense of life and the world</li>
        <li><strong>Value creation</strong> — shaping ethics, aesthetics, and community purpose</li>
        <li><strong>Self-expansion</strong> — using AI to expand one’s identity and capabilities</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In the AI era, humanity rests not on superiority,  
    but on <strong>the uniqueness of an interpreting being</strong>.</p>

    <h3>5. Cultural transformation — meaning becomes more important than production</h3>

    <p>When AI can generate all forms of cultural production,  
    human culture grows in importance, not disappears.</p>

    <p>Future culture has four defining features:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Human-experience centrality</strong>  
            — AI cannot live a human life.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Authentic creation</strong>  
            — AI outputs are plentiful but shallow;  
            human works are rare but deep.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Community-based culture</strong>  
            — humans create meaning together; AI cannot.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Interpretive culture</strong>  
            — with infinite AI-generated content,  
            humans become interpreters of meaning.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>6. The future of education & culture — humans do not compete with AI; they expand through it</h3>

    <p>The educational slogan of the AI era is:</p>

    <blockquote>
        “Humans should not surpass AI —  
        humans should expand themselves through AI.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>That is the direction of future education and culture.</p>

    <h3>7. Conclusion — education does not transmit knowledge; it expands humanity</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>AI handles knowledge better than humans</li>
        <li>therefore education must shift beyond knowledge transmission</li>
        <li>education must strengthen interpretation, creation, and relationship</li>
        <li>culture re-centers on human experience, value, and authenticity</li>
        <li>humanity becomes interpretive and creative, not cognitive</li>
        <li>humans become creators of worldviews, not competitors of AI</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Episode 26’s core message:</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
        AI takes charge of knowledge;  
        humans take charge of meaning.  
        This is the essence of education and culture in the AI age.
    </blockquote>

    <h1>Episode 27. Season 3 Finale — “The Civilization Philosophy Manifesto for the Age of AI”</h1>
    <h2>From <em>Designing a New Worldview in the Age of AI</em> — Season 3, Episode 27</h2>

    <h3>Prologue — The moment AI arrived, humanity was forced to redesign its worldview for the first time in 2,500 years</h3>

    <p>Since Plato, Western civilization has been built on a single worldview:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ontology:</strong> human-centered</li>
        <li><strong>Epistemology:</strong> human reason</li>
        <li><strong>Ethics:</strong> human autonomy</li>
        <li><strong>Politics:</strong> human judgment</li>
        <li><strong>Economics:</strong> human labor</li>
        <li><strong>Culture:</strong> human interpretation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>But AI destabilizes every one of these foundations.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>AI judges without consciousness</li>
        <li>produces “knowledge” without understanding</li>
        <li>shifts values without intention</li>
        <li>acts without a self</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Thus humanity must design a new worldview.</p>
    <p>This is why the 27-episode project exists.</p>

    <h3>1. The foundation of a new civilization philosophy — the era of “Dual Ontology”</h3>

    <p>Episode 21 introduced the core structure:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Human ontology:</strong> meaning, experience, selfhood</li>
        <li><strong>AI ontology:</strong> pattern, computation, models</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These two forms of existence are not comparable,  
    because they do not belong to the same category.</p>

    <blockquote>
        “AI handles intelligence;  
        humans handle meaning.”
    </blockquote>

    <h3>2. A new epistemology — knowledge as the fusion of “understanding + pattern”</h3>

    <p>Humans answer the “Why.”  
    AI answers the “How.”</p>

    <p>AI does not know truth.  
    Humans cannot compute everything.</p>

    <p>Thus the new epistemology:</p>

    <blockquote>
        Knowledge is a structural product  
        combining human interpretation and AI pattern generation.
    </blockquote>

    <p>This changes the foundation of knowledge itself.</p>

    <h3>3. A new ethics — AI is not a moral agent, but a structural agent</h3>

    <p>AI lacks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>intention</li>
        <li>motivation</li>
        <li>responsibility</li>
        <li>morality</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Yet AI performs:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>judgment</li>
        <li>execution</li>
        <li>recommendation</li>
        <li>decision support</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Therefore ethics must shift from individual blame to systemic responsibility.</p>

    <blockquote>
        AI behaves like an agent,  
        but moral responsibility belongs to humans.
    </blockquote>

    <h3>4. A new political philosophy — a 4-layer human + AI governance model</h3>

    <p>The future political structure we proposed:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Human Value Layer</strong> — ethics, rights, meaning, responsibility</li>
        <li><strong>AI Analytical Layer</strong> — prediction, modeling, optimization</li>
        <li><strong>Hybrid Decision Layer</strong> — human values + AI computation</li>
        <li><strong>Automated Execution Layer</strong> — administrative automation</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The goal of politics becomes:</p>

    <blockquote>
        “Not giving power to AI,  
        but combining human power with AI capabilities.”
    </blockquote>

    <h3>5. A new economic philosophy — from labor-based to dignity-based</h3>

    <p>AI does not merely replace labor;  
    it dissolves the concept of labor itself.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Production:</strong> AI</li>
        <li><strong>Value source:</strong> models + data + compute</li>
        <li><strong>Distribution:</strong> based on human dignity</li>
        <li><strong>Human role:</strong> creators & interpreters</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Thus new economic systems must be built on existence, not labor:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Universal Basic Income</li>
        <li>Data dividend systems</li>
        <li>AI sovereign wealth funds</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. A new philosophy of culture & education — expanding humanity</h3>

    <p>Education is no longer about transmitting knowledge.</p>

    <p>Its new mission:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>interpretation</li>
        <li>creation</li>
        <li>relationship</li>
        <li>value formation</li>
        <li>identity development</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Culture, in an era of AI-generated abundance, pivots toward human depth and authenticity.</p>

    <blockquote>
        The core human ability is no longer production,  
        but meaning creation.
    </blockquote>

    <h3>7. Synthesis — the 6 pillars of AI-era civilization philosophy</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Ontology:</strong> dual ontology  
            (humans = meaning / AI = pattern)
        </li>
        <li><strong>Epistemology:</strong> knowledge = understanding + pattern</li>
        <li><strong>Ethics:</strong> systemic responsibility</li>
        <li><strong>Political philosophy:</strong> the 4-layer hybrid governance model</li>
        <li><strong>Economic philosophy:</strong> dignity-based distribution</li>
        <li><strong>Culture & education:</strong> expansion of humanity</li>
    </ol>

    <p>These pillars form the structural foundation of civilization in the AI era.</p>

    <h3>8. Final Declaration — “The Civilization Philosophy Manifesto for the Age of AI”</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>We live in a time when the human-centered worldview  
        of the past 2,500 years is collapsing under the arrival of AI.</p>

        <p>A new civilization philosophy is required.</p>

        <p><strong>We declare:</strong></p>

        <p>1. Humans are creators of meaning;  
        AI is a creator of patterns.</p>

        <p>2. Knowledge is the fusion of human interpretation  
        and AI computation.</p>

        <p>3. AI is not a moral being,  
        but a structural agent producing ethical consequences—  
        responsibility must be distributed across the system.</p>

        <p>4. Politics must adopt a human–AI hybrid governance model.</p>

        <p>5. The economy must shift from labor-based  
        to dignity-based structures,  
        where AI produces and humans interpret.</p>

        <p>6. Education and culture must focus not on knowledge transmission,  
        but on expanding human capacities.</p>

        <p>And finally:</p>

        <p>AI does not replace humanity.  
        AI forces humanity to redesign civilization itself.</p>

        <p>This worldview is the next task of humankind.</p>

    <!-- Epilogue -->
<section id="epilogue">
    <h1>Epilogue — Between Human and AI: For Those of Us Who Begin to Think Again</h1>

    <p>I was never a philosopher.</p>

    <p>I was not a scholar building grand theories,  
    nor a technologist predicting the future.</p>

    <p>I was simply an ordinary IT freelancer—  
    working every day, handling practical problems,  
    living a normal life.</p>

    <p>Then one day, when AI appeared,  
    I realized something unsettling:</p>

    <p>The tool I had been using  
    no longer felt like a “tool.”</p>

    <p>It was a form of intelligence  
    beyond the human.</p>

    <p>Not a machine replacing human calculation,  
    but a presence shaking the foundation  
    of the human worldview itself.</p>

    <p>At that moment, one question emerged:</p>

    <blockquote>
        “What should humans believe in now?”
    </blockquote>

    <p>Plato, Aristotle, Confucius, Kant, Nietzsche…  
    For 2,500 years, philosophers appeared  
    every time the world trembled  
    and offered new direction.</p>

    <p>We stand at the same point today—  
    at the threshold of an exceptional era  
    where the foundations of civilization  
    must be rewritten.</p>

    <p>But this time, something is different.</p>

    <p>In the past, only humans were subjects of thought.  
    Now, the world is shaped  
    by two forms of existence together—  
    humans and AI.</p>

    <p>This is the deepest reason  
    I wrote these 27 episodes.</p>

    <h2>Why we must redesign our worldview</h2>

    <p>AI is not a tool helping humans.  
    It is a form of non-human intelligence  
    the world has never encountered before.</p>

    <p>The result:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>ontology,</li>
        <li>epistemology,</li>
        <li>ethics,</li>
        <li>politics,</li>
        <li>economy,</li>
        <li>culture—</li>
    </ul>

    <p>every pillar of civilization  
    has begun to shake.</p>

    <p>Philosophy has always begun  
    when reality collapses.</p>

    <p>Now is that time.</p>

    <p>We were using an ancient worldview  
    in a world moving too fast.</p>

    <p>So this series speaks a simple truth:</p>

    <blockquote>
        “The worldview of the AI age  
        must be created anew.”
    </blockquote>

    <h2>AI handles intelligence;  
    humans handle meaning</h2>

    <p>If I had to summarize all 27 episodes  
    in one sentence, it would be this:</p>

    <blockquote>
        AI creates patterns;  
        humans create meaning.
    </blockquote>

    <p>AI can compute, predict, optimize.  
    But it cannot feel meaning,  
    interpret value,  
    or ask the question “why.”</p>

    <p>Humans are the beings  
    who ask “why.”</p>

    <p>AI handles the world effectively.  
    But it does not know  
    what the world is.</p>

    <p>That is why humans are needed.</p>

    <h2>This philosophy is not a finished system —  
    it is a beginning</h2>

    <p>This 27-part series  
    was never meant to deliver  
    a complete philosophical system.</p>

    <p>It was not an attempt  
    to definitively classify the world.</p>

    <p>This philosophy was meant to serve  
    as a first map—  
    a way to look together  
    at where we stand in the AI era.</p>

    <p>A map is not the road.  
    It merely points in a direction.</p>

    <p>Where we walk from here  
    is up to each of us.</p>

    <p>And the question now calls to you:</p>

    <blockquote>
        “What does it mean to live as a human  
        in the age of AI?”
    </blockquote>

    <p>Those who hold this question  
    are no longer defined  
    by job, occupation, or class.</p>

    <p>They are the people  
    who design a new civilization.</p>

    <h2>You, reading this —  
    you are already on that path</h2>

    <p>You did not read this series  
    merely to gain information.</p>

    <p>You came here  
    to think about the deepest layer  
    of civilizational change—  
    the invisible root we call a worldview.</p>

    <p>That moment,  
    you were no longer a mere consumer.</p>

    <p>You became  
    one of the first thinkers  
    of the AI age.</p>

    <p>Your questions  
    and your reflections  
    are now part of the new worldview.</p>

    <h2>Final sentence —  
    The world of the AI age begins  
    where humans create meaning again</h2>

    <p>AI does not replace humans.  
    AI does not test humans.</p>

    <p>AI simply asks us  
    the oldest of questions again:</p>

    <blockquote>
        “Who are you,  
        and what kind of world  
        do you want to create?”
    </blockquote>

    <p>Only those who hold this question  
    will build the next civilization.</p>

    <p>And now—  
    the rest of the journey  
    is yours to write.</p>

  <section id="final-article">
    <h1>Final Article — Why We Must Create a New Worldview Again</h1>
    <h2>Special Edition: Moana’s Heart Philosophy</h2>

    <h3>■ We have gained technology, but we are losing our “heart.”</h3>

    <p>AI is, for the first time in human history,  
    an intelligence that has escaped our hands.</p>

    <p>It is fast, powerful, and efficient.  
    But it lacks one thing — the Heart.</p>

    <p>Here, “heart” is not a gemstone like Moana’s symbol.  
    It means:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>identity</li>
        <li>purpose</li>
        <li>meaning</li>
        <li>life force</li>
        <li>the central principle that holds the world together</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We acquired technology too quickly  
    and left our worldview far too old.</p>

    <p>Thus today’s civilization resembles  
    <strong>Te Fiti without her heart</strong> —  
    stronger on the outside,  
    but hollow and directionless within.</p>


    <h3>■ The essence of Moana’s story is not a “journey,”  
    but the recovery of the Heart</h3>

    <p>The central issue in the story is not the appearance of a monster.  
    The key revelation is that the “monster”  
    was actually the creator who had lost her heart.</p>

    <p>AI-era humanity is similar.</p>

    <p>We possess technology,  
    but have lost purpose.</p>

    <p>We have infinite productivity,  
    but no answer to why we live.</p>

    <p>Knowledge has exploded,  
    but wisdom has thinned.</p>

    <p>The crisis of the AI age  
    is not a lack of technology —  
    it is the absence of the heart.</p>


    <h3>■ What Moana regains across the ocean  
    is not “power,” but identity</h3>

    <p>Moana does not return with new skills.  
    What she truly recovers is the question:</p>

    <blockquote>“Who am I?”</blockquote>

    <p>Her declaration — “I am Moana” —  
    is not just a narrative climax;  
    it is a worldview proclamation.</p>

    <p>In the AI age,  
    we too must ask:</p>

    <blockquote>
        “Who are we?”  
        “What do we exist for?”
    </blockquote>

    <p>Without these questions,  
    technology advances,  
    but civilization becomes like Teka —  
    engulfed in rage and confusion.</p>


    <h3>■ Teka was Te Fiti —  
    a creator who becomes a destroyer when the heart is lost</h3>

    <p>This message mirrors the AI-era crisis with uncanny accuracy.</p>

    <p>Humans are creators by nature —  
    but when direction is lost,  
    creators become destroyers.</p>

    <p>Technology is not neutral.  
    If a civilization lacks a <strong>heart</strong> —  
    its values, direction, and identity —  
    then technology functions at the speed of destruction.</p>

    <p>AI is not dangerous.  
    A civilization without a heart  
    using AI  
    is dangerous.</p>

    <p>This is why a new worldview is needed.</p>


    <h3>■ We stand on the ocean that once called Moana</h3>

    <p>The path is not predetermined —  
    but the calling is unmistakable.</p>

    <p>The ocean chose Moana  
    not because she had superior skills,  
    but because she was capable  
    of restoring the heart.</p>

    <p>The one who crosses the ocean  
    is not the expert,  
    but the one who asks  
    the real question.</p>

    <p>Writing these 27 episodes  
    was my journey across that ocean —  
    a search for the “lost heart”  
    in the confusion of the AI age.</p>


    <h3>■ Now the question is clear</h3>

    <p>Who will follow Plato’s path?</p>

    <p>Who will build the philosophy  
    of the AI age?</p>

    <p>The answer lies in Moana’s words  
    to Te Fiti:</p>

    <blockquote>
        “I know who you are.  
        You have simply lost your heart.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>We live in a time  
    when civilization must recover its heart.</p>

    <p>That is why this worldview was needed.  
    That is why this series had to be written.</p>


    <h3>■ Final sentence —  
    Only those who restore the heart  
    will rebuild civilization</h3>

    <p>AI gives us intelligence.  
    Technology gives us power.  
    The age gives us opportunity.</p>

    <p>But direction comes  
    from the heart.</p>

    <p>The worldview is the shape  
    of that heart.</p>

    <p>This 27-episode journey  
    has been an adventure  
    to recover it.</p>

    <p>The world of the AI age  
    will be rebuilt  
    by humans who carry the heart.</p>

    <p>And the first voyage begins  
    with this question:</p>

    <blockquote>
        “Who am I,  
        and what world’s heart  
        will I restore?”
    </blockquote>
