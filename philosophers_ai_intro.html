<h1>🌊 Where Should Philosophers Set Sail in the Age of AI?</h1>
<h2>— Preface to an 80-Part Series</h2>

<section>
<p>
We are living in an era where AI accelerates human intellectual activity, reshapes patterns of thought, and shakes the very foundations of meaning.
Like the narrative of <em>Moana</em>, where an island slowly begins to wither,
our world appears abundant on the surface while cracks form beneath.
</p>

<p>
There is more data than ever, yet the ocean becomes increasingly unpredictable.
Our tools grow more powerful, but the human mind loses its sense of direction.
The waves of technology are enormous, yet our philosophical compass remains uncalibrated.
</p>

<p>This series begins precisely with that question:</p>

<p><strong>Where should philosophy go in the age of AI?</strong></p>

<p>
Are analytic and continental philosophy still valid, or do we need entirely new nautical skills?
How will human meaning, creativity, and narrative be reconstructed in the future?
</p>

<p>
This large-scale 80-part philosophical voyage does not remain in simple analysis or academic summary.
Here, philosophy is not “the transmission of knowledge” but “the art of navigation.”
Just as Moana discovers a new world by venturing into the sea, we too sail outward to expand the horizons of thought.
</p>

<section>
<h2 class="emoji">🔍 Why <em>Moana</em>?</h2>

<p><em>Moana</em> is not merely a Disney animation.</p>

<p>Its narrative has profound structural parallels to the crisis of the human spirit in the age of AI:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The island begins to wither → the collapse of meaning</li>
  <li>The call of the sea → the revival of philosophical inquiry</li>
  <li>Tefiti’s wound → damage to the human center caused by technological civilization</li>
  <li>Maui’s power → the dual nature of technology: creation and destruction</li>
  <li>The journey to restore the heart → the recovery of the human–world relationship</li>
</ul>

<p>
This 80-part series uses Moana’s mythic structure as an allegorical map
to explore the direction of human intelligence in the world “after AI.”
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2 class="emoji">⚖️ Analytic Philosophy, Continental Philosophy, and Beyond</h2>

<p>
AI can replace parts of the analytic tradition that sought clarity and precision.
Meanwhile, continental philosophy—concerned with worldview, narrative, and the structures of meaning—
may gain even greater importance in the age of AI.
</p>

<p>
But this series does not proclaim the victory of one over the other.
Rather, it argues that both routes remain meaningful in different ways,
and that true navigation happens in the space where the two intersect.
</p>

<p>
By following the flow of all 80 parts, one will see that the philosopher’s role is not to choose sides
but to invent new intellectual methods of navigation.
