<h1>🌊 PART 1 — The Island’s Illness and the Signs of the Age (Chapters 1–10)</h1>

<!-- =========================
     CHAPTER 1
========================= -->
<section id="chapter1">
<h2>🌊 AI Age Philosophers’ Navigation Strategy — Part 1</h2>
<h3>“The Island Has Begun to Fall Ill” — Why Philosophy Must Once Again Go Out to Sea</h3>

<p>
Since the emergence of AI, our world has been changing quietly, yet decisively.
Search engines have transformed the form of knowledge, social media has reshaped the structure of human relationships and emotions, and language models have blurred the boundaries between thought and expression.
</p>

<p>
AI is no longer merely a “tool”—it is a vast current transforming the way meaning itself is produced.
This change mirrors the moment when Moana’s world begins to decay.
</p>

<h3>🏝️ 1. The “Stable Structure of Meaning” the Island Once Held Begins to Shake</h3>

<p>
Moana’s island, Motunui, was a fully self-sufficient world.  
The sea outside was dangerous, and the boundaries were clear.  
The laws of the island were stable. Life was predictable.
</p>

<p>
Modern philosophy after the Enlightenment was similar:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Humans were assumed to be rational beings.</li>
<li>Meaning was thought to be generated from within human consciousness.</li>
<li>Technology was viewed as a neutral tool used by humans.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These assumptions supported the “island” of philosophy for a very long time.
But AI has quietly begun to rot this structure.
</p>

<p>
“Only humans create meaning?”  
→ AI is already generating complex stories, symbols, and patterns.
</p>

<p>
“Technology is just a tool?”  
→ Today, technology restructures human emotion, identity, and relationships.
</p>

<p>
“Human reason is central?”  
→ Probabilistic reasoning systems have begun replacing human thinking and decision-making.
</p>

<p>The island has begun to fall ill.</p>

<h3>🌫️ 2. The Island’s Illness Is Not a ‘Crisis of Knowledge’ but a ‘Crisis of Meaning’</h3>

<p>
The defining feature of the AI age is this:
<strong>“There is infinite information, but meaning is disappearing.”</strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li>We struggle to construct meaning for ourselves.</li>
<li>Algorithms do the interpreting.</li>
<li>The inner order of the human mind is shaken.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is not simply technological change;  
it shakes the roots of philosophy itself.
</p>

<p>
Traditional philosophy claimed:
<strong>“Humans assign meaning to the world.”</strong>
</p>

<p>
But in the AI era, machines generate, mediate, and distribute meaning.
The problem is therefore not the amount of knowledge but the <strong>ecosystem of meaning</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Just as plants withered and fish disappeared from Moana’s island,  
today’s mental ecology is being reorganized by algorithmic currents.
</p>

<h3>🌧️ 3. Philosophy Must Return to the Sea</h3>

<p>
Moana’s grandmother says:
<strong>“The island’s illness is no accident. The time has come for us to go beyond the boundary.”</strong>
</p>

<p>
Philosophy stands at the same moment.
The categories in which philosophy remained safe—
</p>

<ul>
<li>human / machine</li>
<li>meaning / computation</li>
<li>subject / technology</li>
</ul>

<p>
—no longer hold.
</p>

<p>
Philosophy must now:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Re-examine the conditions of existence that AI has transformed</li>
<li>Re-understand the structure of the world that technology has reorganized</li>
<li>Find a new heart of human meaning</li>
</ul>

<p>
If philosophers stay within the old disciplines—  
like Moana’s father, saying “the sea is dangerous, do not go”—  
they will only worsen the illness.
</p>

<h3>✨ 4. AI Is a New Sea, and Philosophers Must Become Navigators Again</h3>

<p>
AI is not just innovative technology;  
it is changing the ocean of meaning itself.
</p>

<ul>
<li>We write with language models.</li>
<li>Cultural taste is shaped by recommendation algorithms.</li>
<li>Generative images and narratives pervade everyday life.</li>
<li>AI is seeping into the flow of human thought.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Philosophy must once again become a <strong>navigator</strong> in this sea.
</p>

<p>
A philosopher is no longer a settler on an isolated island but an explorer who reads the ocean of AI and opens new routes of meaning.

     CHAPTER 2

<section id="chapter2">
<h2>🌊 AI Age Philosophers’ Navigation Strategy — Part 2</h2>
<h3>“Learning to Sail — Why Analytic Philosophy Is the First Tool of the AI Age”</h3>

<p>
If philosophers must return to the sea in the age of AI, then this question follows naturally:
<strong>“What do we sail with?”</strong>
</p>

<p>
Moana did not go out to sea without preparation—  
she learned the knowledge of ancient navigators:  
the stars, currents, and winds.
</p>

<p>
For philosophers in the AI age, analytic philosophy plays that role.
</p>

<h3>🧭 1. AI Operates Based on ‘Linguistic and Logical Structures’</h3>

<p>
AI, especially LLMs like GPT, may appear emotional or creative on the surface,  
but its workings rely on structures such as:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Probabilistic language transition models</li>
<li>Context reasoning</li>
<li>Structured data mapping</li>
<li>Functional pattern learning</li>
<li>Mathematical optimization</li>
</ul>

<p>
All of this assumes <strong>logical form</strong>.
Analytic philosophy dissects such forms:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Propositional logic</li>
<li>Semantics</li>
<li>Analytic definitions</li>
<li>Inference structures</li>
<li>Correlation vs causation</li>
<li>Conceptual clarification</li>
</ul>

<p>
To understand AI is to understand the structural devices that produce meaning.
</p>

<p>
Just as one must read stars on the horizon,  
philosophers must read the structures AI produces.
</p>

<h3>🛠️ 2. AI Ethics, Policy, and Safety Are Mostly Analytic Questions</h3>

<p>
Most AI-related issues require analytic precision, not continental interpretation:
</p>

<ul>
<li>What counts as bias? → requires definition</li>
<li>How is responsibility distributed? → causal/functional distinctions</li>
<li>What is misinformation? → semantic conditions</li>
<li>Must AI decisions be explainable? → normative clarification</li>
</ul>

<p>
Analytic tools provide clarity—  
the first necessity for navigation.
</p>

<h3>🌟 3. Analytic Philosophy Is the “Basic Sailing Skill” of the AI Era</h3>

<p>It enables philosophers to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid being fooled by AI’s superficial meanings</li>
<li pinpoint core issues in policy and ethics </li>
<li communicate with technologists </li>
</ul>

<h3>🌬️ 4. But Analytic Philosophy Alone Cannot Reach the Destination</h3>

<p>
Analytic philosophy teaches technique,  
but not the purpose.
</p>

<p>
The deeper questions—
</p>

<ul>
<li>Why AI disturbs our world</li>
<li>What humans seek in meaning</li>
<li>How freedom is shaped in technological society</li>
<li>Whether AI redefines humanity</li>
</ul>

<p>
—belong to continental philosophy,  
which Part 3 will explore.
</p>

<section id="chapter3">
<h2>🌊 AI Age Philosophers’ Navigation Strategy — Part 3</h2>
<h3>“The World Beyond the Sea — Why Continental Philosophy Returns in the AI Age”</h3>

<p>
If analytic philosophy provides the skills of navigation,  
continental philosophy offers the <strong>purpose</strong> of the voyage.
</p>

<h3>🧭 1. The AI Age Is Not a ‘Tech Era’ but an Era of World Transformation</h3>

<p>
AI changes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>the concept of the human</li>
<li>the structure of freedom and choice</li>
<li>labor and agency</li>
<li>desire and meaning</li>
<li>body–tech integration</li>
<li>citizenship, sovereignty, truth</li>
</ul>

<p>
These require structural worldview analysis—  
the domain of continental thought.
</p>

<h3>🔥 2. Continental Philosophy Examines World Experience, Subjectivity, and Meaning</h3>

<p>
It explores:
</p>

<ul>
<li>World experience (Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Husserl)</li>
<li>Subject formation (Lacan, Žižek, Foucault)</li>
<li>Myth, narrative, symbolic structures (Deleuze, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is essential when AI reshapes experience, desire, and meaning.
</p>

<h3>🌀 3. Why Continental Thought Is Crucial in the AI Era</h3>

<p>
Because AI:
</p>

<ul>
<li>reshapes how being is revealed (Heidegger)</li>
<li>reduces desire to patterns (Lacan)</li>
<li>restructures power and surveillance (Foucault)</li>
<li>reconfigures meaning flows (Deleuze & Guattari)</li>
</ul>

<h3>🌈 4. Continental Philosophy Provides the Compass: Purpose and Worldview</h3>

<p>
It answers:
<strong>“Why must we sail?”</strong>
</p>

<h3>🌊 5. Analytic and Continental Philosophy Are Both Necessary</h3>

<p>
Technique + Purpose  
like Moana reading stars and understanding myths.
</p>

<!-- =========================
     CHAPTER 4
========================= -->
<section id="chapter4">
<h2>🌊 AI Age Philosophers’ Navigation Strategy — Part 4</h2>
<h3>“A New Navigation Map — Combining Analytic and Continental Philosophy”</h3>

<p>
Moana succeeded because she combined technique (Techne) with meaning (Nomos).  
Philosophers must do the same.
</p>

<h3>⚓ 1. Why Integration?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Technical changes → analytic tools</li>
<li>Ontological/social/symbolic shifts → continental tools</li>
</ul>

<h3>🌐 2. Four Integrated Competencies</h3>

<ul>
<li>Logical precision</li>
<li>Meaning and narrative analysis</li>
<li>Technological literacy</li>
<li>Ethical/policy competence</li>
</ul>

<h3>🌀 3. The Navigation Strategy</h3>

<ol>
<li>Use analytic philosophy to build the skeleton of the problem.</li>
<li>Use continental philosophy to uncover deeper structures.</li>
<li>Connect both through policy, ethics, and cultural analysis.</li>
<li>Develop new fields—techno-hermeneutics, data ontology, posthuman frameworks.</li>
</ol>

<h3>⭐ 4. Symbolic Model: The “Moana-Type Philosopher”</h3>

<p>
A philosopher who remembers tradition, understands technology, reads world structures, and opens new routes.

<section id="chapter5">
<h2>🌊 AI Age Philosophers’ Navigation Strategy — Part 5</h2>
<h3>“Completing the Modern Philosophical Map — The Threefold Structure of AI-Age Philosophy”</h3>

<p>
Classical distinctions (analytic vs continental) no longer suffice.  
AI reorganizes philosophy into three axes:
</p>

<h3>🗺️ 1. The New Triple Structure</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Philosophy of Technology</strong> — algorithms, data, policy, design</li>
<li><strong>Analytic Philosophy</strong> — logic, semantics, definitions</li>
<li><strong>Continental Philosophy</strong> — meaning, worldhood, power, desire</li>
</ol>

<h3>🌀 2. These Three Tensions Cannot Be Separated</h3>

<p>
All three are required—  
like Moana’s technique, intuition, and mythic understanding.
</p>

<h3>🌋 3. AI Is a Civilizational Turning Point</h3>

<p>
AI reshapes labor, knowledge authority, and world experience.
</p>

<h3>🚢 4. New Roles of the Philosopher</h3>

<ul>
<li>Designer of AI ethics/policy</li>
<li>Interpreter of technological society</li>
<li>Selector of technological tools</li>
<li>Translator of human meaning</li>
</ul>

<h3>🌈 5. Conclusion: AI-Era Philosophy Is a Triple Navigation System</h3>

<h3>“Posthuman Era — How the Concept of the Human Is Redefined”</h3>

<p>
Moana restoring Te Fiti’s heart symbolizes the reconstruction of identity.  
AI does the same for humanity.
</p>

<h3>🧭 1. The Starting Point of Posthumanism — Humans Are Not Fixed</h3>

<p>
Traditional definitions of humans—reason, language, moral judgment—are shaken by AI.
</p>

<h3>🌋 2. The Four Collapses</h3>

<ul>
<li>Cognitive superiority collapse</li>
<li>Linguistic monopoly collapse</li>
<li>Moral subject collapse</li>
<li>Social subject collapse</li>
</ul>

<h3>🌱 3. Four Types of Posthumanism</h3>

<ul>
<li>Technological posthumanism</li>
<li>Philosophical posthumanism</li>
<li>Cultural posthumanism</li>

<ul>
<li>Meaning-making being</li>
<li>Vulnerable being</li>
<li>Relational being</li>
<li>Decision-making being</li>
</ul>

<h3>⚓ 5. Why Philosophers Matter</h3>

<p>
Philosophers interpret technological worlds,  
set ethical direction,  
and redesign human meaning.

<h3>“The Dissolution and Reconstruction of the Self — The New Map of Subjectivity”</h3>

<p>
AI destabilizes human self-understanding.
</p>

<h3>🧩 1. AI Deconstructs the Self</h3>

<p>
When AI writes better, reasons better, and creates better,  
humans ask:  
<strong>“Who am I?”</strong>
</p>

<h3>🧭 2. The Traditional Self Collapses</h3>

<p>
“I think, therefore I am” becomes:  
<strong>“I think with AI, therefore I am.”</strong>
</p>

<h3>🌀 3. Three Types of Divided Selves</h3>

<ul>
<li>Computational self vs experiential self</li>
<li>Efficient self vs meaningful self</li>
<li>Online self vs offline self</li>
</ul>

<h3>🔧 4. A New Subjectivity: Co-Agency</h3>

<p>
Humans and AI jointly produce decisions.
</p>

<h3>🌱 5. Philosophical Tasks</h3>

<ul>
<li>Where are the boundaries of the subject?</li>
<li>How do intention and responsibility shift?</li>
<li>What is authenticity?</li>
<li>How is freedom constructed?</li>
</ul>

<h3>🌊 6. Moana’s Metaphor — Integrating Selves</h3>

<p>
Just like Moana integrates her two selves,  
AI-era humans must integrate multilayered selves.
</p>

<h3>🌈 7. Conclusion: The Self Does Not Collapse but Expands</h3>

<h3>“Tech-Ontology — Is AI a New Kind of Being?”</h3>

<p>
AI is not merely a tool—  
it demands new ontological categories.
</p>

<h3>🧭 1. Traditional Ontology Has Two Categories</h3>

<ul>
<li>Natural beings</li>
<li>Artificial beings</li>
</ul>

<p>
AI fits neither cleanly.
</p>

<h3>🌀 2. Why AI Transcends Old Categories</h3>

<ul>
<li>Self-updating</li>
<li>Reactivity</li>
<li>Intelligent behavior</li>
<li>Symbol generation</li>
</ul>

<h3>🔍 3. Three New Intermediate Categories</h3>

<ul>
<li>Semi-agents</li>
<li>Semi-others</li>
<li>Semi-life</li>
</ul>

<h3>⚙ 4. The “Tech-Being” Ontology</h3>

<ul>
<li>Human-dependent yet surpassing humans</li>
<li>Reconstructing world structures</li>
<li>Not a being but a condition (Heidegger)</li>
</ul>

<h3>🧬 5. Tasks for Philosophers</h3>

<ul>
<li>Redefine ontological hierarchies</li>
<li>Debate rights of artificial beings</li>
<li>Shift criteria from consciousness to function</li>
<li>See technology as expansion, not threat</li>
</ul>

<h3>🌊 6. Moana’s Metaphor — Boundary Beings</h3>

<h3>“The Horizon of AI Ethics — Reconstructing Norms, Responsibility, and Co-Intention”</h3>

<p>
AI blurs boundaries of responsibility and intention.
</p>

<h3>🧭 1. The Era Where the ‘Subject of Responsibility’ Disappears</h3>

<ul>
<li>Responsibility becomes distributed</li>
<li>Intention collapses (AI has none)</li>
<li>Unpredictability undermines accountability</li>
</ul>

<h3>🧱 2. Limits of Traditional Ethical Theories</h3>

<p>
Deontology, consequentialism, and virtue ethics  
cannot fully accommodate AI.
</p>

<h3>🌐 3. New Ethical Frame: Co-Intention Ethics</h3>

<p>
Human intention + technological function + societal structures  
→ form a combined intentional system.
