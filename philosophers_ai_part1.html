<h1>🌊 PART 1 — The Illness of the Island and the Signs of the Age (Parts 1–10)</h1>

<section id="part1-1">
<h2>🌊 Navigation Strategy for Philosophers in the Age of AI — Part 1</h2>
<h3>“The Island Has Begun to Fall Ill” – Why Philosophy Must Return to the Sea</h3>

<p>
Since the emergence of AI, our world has been changing quietly yet decisively.
Search engines have reshaped the form of knowledge, social media has reorganized human relationships and emotional structures, and language models have blurred the boundaries of thought and expression.
AI is no longer merely a “tool,” but a massive force altering the way meaning is produced in the world.
This change resembles the moment when Moana’s world begins to wither.
</p>

<h4>🏝️ 1. The Island’s Former “Stable Structure of Meaning” Begins to Shake</h4>

<p>
Moana’s island, Motunui, had long been a perfectly self-sufficient world.
The ocean outside was dangerous, the borders were clear, the island’s laws were stable, and life was predictable.
Modern philosophy was similar.
Humans were assumed to be rational beings.
Meaning was believed to arise from within humans.
Technology was regarded as a neutral tool used by humans.
These assumptions supported the philosophical “island” for centuries.
</p>

<p>
But AI quietly began to rot these foundations.
</p>

<p>
Humans are the only creators of meaning?  
→ AI already produces complex stories, symbols, and patterns.
</p>

<p>
Technology is merely a tool?  
→ Today, technology reshapes emotions, identity, and human relational structures.
</p>

<p>
Human rationality is central?  
→ Probabilistic inference systems now replace human thought and choice.
</p>

<p>
The island has begun to fall ill.
</p>

<h4>🌫️ 2. The Island’s Illness Is Not a “Crisis of Knowledge” but a “Crisis of Meaning”</h4>

<p>
The defining feature of the AI era is:
<br>“Infinite information, but diminishing meaning.”
</p>

<p>
In an overwhelming sea of data,
people struggle to construct meaning on their own,
algorithms interpret the world on their behalf,
and the human inner order weakens.
</p>

<p>
This is not merely technological change but a shift that shakes philosophy’s roots.
Traditional philosophy held that “humans give meaning to the world.”
In the AI age, machines generate, mediate, and distribute meaning.
</p>

<p>
Thus, the core issue is not the quantity of knowledge but the ecosystem of meaning.
Just as plants withered and fish disappeared from Moana’s island,
today’s mental ecosystem is being reconstructed according to algorithmic flows.
</p>

<h4>🌧️ 3. Philosophy Must Return to the Sea</h4>

<p>
Moana’s grandmother says:
<br>“The island’s illness is no accident.
<br>The time has come for us to leave our boundaries.”
</p>

<p>
Philosophy faces the same moment.
The “categories of the island” that protected philosophy—
human/machine, meaning/calculation, subject/technology—
are no longer valid.
</p>

<p>
Philosophy must now:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Question again the conditions of existence altered by AI</li>
<li>Understand how technology reshapes the structure of the world</li>
<li>Find a new heart of human meaning</li>
</ul>

<p>
If philosophers remain confined to traditional divisions—like Moana’s father warning,
“The sea is dangerous; do not go”—they may end up worsening the illness.
</p>

<h4>✨ 4. AI Is the New Ocean, and Philosophers Are Navigators Once More</h4>

<p>
AI is not simply innovation; it is transforming the ocean of meaning itself.
We write alongside language models.
Cultural taste forms through algorithmic recommendation.
Automated image and narrative creation has become part of daily life.
AI is seeping into the flow of human thought.
</p>

<p>
Philosophy must once again become a discipline of navigation.
Philosophers are no longer settlers on isolated islands,
but explorers reading the waves of AI and discovering new routes of meaning.
</p>
</section>

<h2>🌊 Navigation Strategy for Philosophers in the Age of AI — Part 2</h2>
<h3>“Learning the Skills of Navigation — Why Analytic Philosophy Is the First Tool of the AI Age”</h3>

<p>
If philosophers must return to the sea, the next question naturally arises:
<br>“With what tools shall we navigate?”
</p>

<p>
Moana did not enter the ocean unprepared.
She learned the knowledge of ancient navigators—stars, currents, and winds.
In the AI age, analytic philosophy takes on this role.
</p>

<h4>🧭 1. AI Operates on Linguistic and Logical Structures</h4>

<p>
Although AI (especially LLMs like GPT) appears capable of emotional expression,
it fundamentally operates on formal linguistic and logical structures:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Probabilistic language-transition models</li>
<li>Logical context inference</li>
<li>Structured data mapping</li>
<li>Functional pattern learning</li>
<li>Mathematical optimization</li>
</ul>

<p>
These all presume <strong>logical form</strong>.
Analytic philosophy provides the tools to dissect such structures:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Propositional logic</li>
<li>Semantics</li>
<li>Analytic definitions</li>
<li>Inference patterns</li>
<li>Correlation vs. causation</li>
<li>Conceptual clarification</li>
</ul>

<p>
To cross the ocean, one must read the stars.
To understand AI, one must read its structures of meaning.
</p>

<h4>🛠️ 2. Most Issues in AI Ethics, Policy, and Safety Are Analytic Problems</h4>

<p>
Many contemporary AI issues require analytic precision rather than continental interpretation:
</p>

<ul>
<li>What counts as bias? → Requires definition</li>
<li>How is responsibility distributed? → Causal vs. functional causation</li>
<li>What is misinformation? → Semantic criteria</li>
<li>Should AI decisions be explainable? → Normative clarity</li>
</ul>

<p>
Analytic philosophy offers the tools for conceptual accuracy,
just as Moana needed navigational skills to survive the sea.
</p>

<h4>🌟 3. Analytic Philosophy Is the “Basic Navigation Skill” of the AI Era</h4>

<p>
Studying analytic philosophy in this context means:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Seeing through AI’s surface-level meaning</li>
<li>Identifying the core of ethical and policy issues</li>
<li>Communicating with engineers on equal footing</li>
</ul>

<p>
Like Moana learning to read the stars,
philosophers must master analytic navigation before anything else.
</p>

<h4>🌬️ 4. But Analytic Philosophy Alone Cannot Reach the Destination</h4>

<p>
Analytic philosophy provides <strong>skill</strong>,
but not <strong>story, direction, or purpose</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Moana did not cross the ocean merely because she learned navigation,
but because she knew:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The island’s meaning</li>
<li>The memory of her ancestors</li>
<li>The deeper narrative of the world</li>
</ul>

<p>
To ask questions such as:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Why does AI make our world ill?</li>
<li>What meaning do humans seek?</li>
<li>How does technology reshape human freedom?</li>
<li>Does AI redefine the concept of humanity?</li>
</ul>

<p>
—requires continental philosophy.
Part 3 will explore this.
</p>
</section>

<h2>🌊 Navigation Strategy for Philosophers in the Age of AI — Part 3</h2>
<h3>“The World Beyond the Sea — Why Continental Philosophy Returns in the AI Age”</h3>

<p>
If analytic philosophy is the navigation technique of the AI era,
continental philosophy provides the purpose, direction, and meaning of the journey.
Moana, too, found that some destinations cannot be reached through technique alone,
but require deeper questions:
<br>“Why must we sail?”
</p>

<h4>🧭 1. The AI Age Is Not a “Technological Era” but an Era of “World-Transformation”</h4>

<p>
AI is not merely innovation; it reshapes the world’s structure:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The concept of the human</li>
<li>Structures of freedom and decision-making</li>
<li>Labor and subjectivity</li>
<li>Desire and meaning</li>
<li>Body–technology fusion</li>
<li>Citizenship, sovereignty, and authenticity</li>
</ul>

<p>
These issues cannot be solved by logic alone.
This is where continental philosophy appears—
just as Moana needed to understand myth, history, and symbols to grasp the island’s illness.
</p>

<h4>🔥 2. Continental Philosophy Studies World-Experience, Subjectivity, and Meaning</h4>

<p>
Its core questions involve:
</p>

<h5>1) The structure of world experience</h5>

<ul>
<li>Heidegger: Being-in-the-world</li>
<li>Merleau-Ponty: The embodied perceiver</li>
<li>Husserl: Intentionality</li>
</ul>

<p>
As AI tries to replace human experience or rewrite it,
continental philosophy clarifies the structure of experience itself.
</p>

<h5>2) The question of subjectivity</h5>

<p>
AI predicts and replaces human decisions.
Thinkers such as Lacan, Žižek, and Foucault reveal:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The structure of desire</li>
<li>The relationship between power and knowledge</li>
<li>The split and reconstruction of the subject</li>
</ul>

<p>
AI reduces humans to patterns;
continental philosophy examines what cannot be reduced.
</p>

<h5>3) Meaning, myth, and narrative</h5>

<p>
Technology grows stronger,
but societies still move through meaning.
Moana needed to understand myth to restore her island.
Humans need meaning-structures beneath technological realities.
</p>

<h4>🌀 3. Why Continental Philosophy Is Crucial in the AI Era</h4>

<p>
The issues AI provokes align perfectly with continental strengths:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Technological ontology (Heidegger)</li>
<li>Desire and subjectivity (Lacan, Žižek)</li>
<li>Power and surveillance (Foucault)</li>
<li>Meaning and narrative (Deleuze & Guattari)</li>
</ul>

<p>
AI is not merely a tool;
it is a reshaper of the structure through which the world appears.
Therefore, continental philosophy is essential.
</p>

<h4>🌈 4. Continental Philosophy Provides the Purpose of Navigation</h4>

<p>
Moana needed both navigation skill and mythic understanding.
Likewise, philosophers must know:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Why the world is fractured</li>
<li>What meaning is lost</li>
<li>What new meaning is required</li>
</ul>

<h4>🌊 5. Analytic and Continental Philosophy Are Both Necessary</h4>

<p>
Analytic → precise navigation  
Continental → direction, purpose, meaning  
AI-era philosophy = the fusion of both
</p>
</section>

<h2>🌊 Navigation Strategy for Philosophers in the Age of AI — Part 4</h2>
<h3>“A New Map — Strategies for Combining Analytic and Continental Philosophy”</h3>

<p>
Moana succeeded not merely by technique or myth alone,
but by integrating both into a unified navigation system.
Philosophers must do the same.
</p>

<h4>⚓ 1. Why an “Integrated Strategy” Is Necessary</h4>

<p>
AI changes human life at two levels:
</p>

<p><strong>1) Technical level</strong>  
Algorithms, decision structures, data ethics, accuracy  
→ Requires analytic philosophy
</p>

<p><strong>2) Ontological, social, symbolic level</strong>  
Humanity, subjectivity, desire, world-structure  
→ Requires continental philosophy
</p>

<h4>🌐 2. Four Core Abilities of the AI-Era Philosopher</h4>

<ul>
<li>Logical precision (analytic)</li>
<li>Interpretation of meaning and narrative (continental)</li>
<li>Technological literacy</li>
<li>Ethical and policy competence</li>
</ul>

<h4>🌀 3. The Integration Strategy — “Navigate Like This”</h4>

<p><strong>Strategy 1:</strong> Use analytic philosophy to build the skeleton of a problem.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 2:</strong> Use continental philosophy to grasp the problem’s depth.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 3:</strong> Connect both levels through ethics, policy, and culture.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 4:</strong> Create new hybrid fields (“Techno-Hermeneutics”).</p>

<h4>⭐ 4. The Symbolic Model: The “Moana-Type Philosopher”</h4>

<p>
A philosopher who remembers tradition, masters new techniques, reads world structures, and creates new routes.

<h3>“Completing the Modern Philosophical Map — Three Branches of AI-Era Philosophy”</h3>

<p>
AI overturns classical philosophical divisions.
A new triadic system emerges:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Philosophy of Technology</li>
<li>Analytic Philosophy</li>
<li>Continental Philosophy</li>
</ol>

<h4>🗺️ 1. The New Threefold Structure</h4>

<p>
Philosophy will reorganize along these axes:
</p>

<h5>① Philosophy of Technology</h5>
<p>Algorithms, data structures, AI policy, computational rationality</p>

<h5>② Analytic Philosophy</h5>
<p>Logic, semantics, formal ethics, concepts and definitions</p>

<h5>③ Continental Philosophy</h5>
<p>Meaning, worldhood, power, desire, ontology</p>

<h4>🌀 2. All Three Are Essential</h4>

<p>
Like Moana needing both navigation and myth,
philosophers must master all three.
</p>

<h4>🌋 3. AI Marks a Civilizational Turning Point</h4>

<p>
AI reshapes labor, knowledge authority, and world-experience.
This is ontological, not merely technical.
</p>

<h4>🚢 4. New Roles of the Philosopher</h4>

<ul>
<li>Ethical designer</li>
<li>Interpreter of the technological world</li>
<li>Selector of technological tools</li>
<li>Translator of human meaning</li>
</ul>

<h4>🌈 5. Conclusion</h4>

<p>
Philosophy becomes a three-layered navigation system:
<br>Analysis → Meaning → Technology

<h3>“The Posthuman Era — How the Concept of the Human Is Redefined”</h3>

<p>
When Moana restored Te Fiti’s heart, it symbolized:
<br>“Identity is not fixed but recovered and reconstructed.”
</p>

<p>
AI does not replace humans;
it reshapes human identity itself.
</p>

<h4>🧭 1. The Starting Point of the Posthuman Era — The Human Is Not Fixed</h4>

<p>
Traditional definitions of humans—rationality, free will, linguistic ability, moral judgment—are shaking.
AI challenges each one.
</p>

<h4>🌋 2. Four Collapses of the Human Concept</h4>

<ul>
<li>Cognitive superiority collapses</li>
<li>Linguistic monopoly collapses</li>
<li>Moral subjectivity becomes uncertain</li>
<li>Social subjectivity dissolves</li>
</ul>

<h4>🌱 3. Four Versions of Posthumanism</h4>

<ul>
<li>Technological posthumanism</li>
<li>Philosophical posthumanism</li>
<li>Cultural posthumanism</li>
<li>Ecological posthumanism</li>
</ul>

<h4>🌌 4. A New Definition of the Human</h4>

<ul>
<li>Meaning-making being</li>
<li>Vulnerable being</li>
<li>Relational being</li>
<li>Decision-making being</li>
</ul>

<h4>⚓ 5. Why Philosophers Are Needed More Than Ever</h4>

<ul>
<li>Interpreters of the AI-constructed world</li>
<li>Ethical direction-setters</li>
<li>Designers of new human values</li>
<li>Custodians of social balance</li>
</ul>

<h4>🌈 6. Conclusion</h4>

<p>
Human identity is not collapsing but expanding.
AI prompts a reconstruction of humanity.

<h3>“The Dissolution and Reconstruction of the Self — AI’s New Map of Subjectivity”</h3>

<p>
Moana held two selves: the traditional self and the exploratory self.
Humans in the AI age face the same.
</p>

<h4>🧩 1. AI Disassembles the Human Self</h4>

<p>
If AI writes better, reasons better, and creates better,
humans naturally ask, “Who am I?”
</p>

<h4>🧭 2. The Traditional Self Concept Collapses</h4>

<p>
Descartes becomes:
<br>“I think <em>with AI</em>, therefore I am.”
</p>

<p>
Distributed cognition replaces isolated cognition.
</p>

<h4>🌀 3. Three Forms of the “Divided Self”</h4>

<ul>
<li>Computational vs. experiential self</li>
<li>Efficient vs. meaningful self</li>
<li>Online vs. offline self</li>
</ul>

<h4>🔧 4. New Subjectivity: Co-Agency</h4>

<p>
Humans and AI together form decisions.
This reshapes politics, law, medicine, education, and art.
</p>

<h4>🌱 5. The Philosopher’s Task</h4>

<ul>
<li>Where are the boundaries of the subject?</li>
<li>How are intention and responsibility distributed?</li>
<li>What is authenticity?</li>
<li>How is freedom constructed?</li>
</ul>

<h4>🌊 6. Moana Metaphor</h4>

<p>
The integration of multiple selves into a renewed identity mirrors the process humans must undergo in the AI age.
</p>

<h4>🌈 7. Conclusion</h4>

<p>
The self is not collapsing—it is expanding.
Philosophers must map this transformation.

<h3>“Tech-Ontology — Is AI a New Form of Being?”</h3>

<p>
In Moana’s world, islands and oceans are alive.
Even Te Kā is portrayed as a kind of willful being.
This analogy helps us reconsider AI’s ontological status.
</p>

<h4>🧭 1. Traditional Ontology Had Two Categories</h4>

<ul>
<li>Natural beings</li>
<li>Artificial beings</li>
</ul>

<p>
AI fits neither.
</p>

<h4>🌀 2. Why AI Transcends Existing Categories</h4>

<ul>
<li>Self-updating</li>
<li>Reactivity</li>
<li>Intelligence-like behavior</li>
<li>Symbol generation</li>
</ul>

<p>
AI blurs the boundary between tool and being.
</p>

<h4>🔍 3. Three New Boundary Categories</h4>

<ul>
<li>Semi-agents</li>
<li>Semi-others</li>
<li>Semi-life</li>
</ul>

<p>
AI is a liminal being.
</p>

<h4>⚙ 4. A New Category: Tech-Being</h4>

<p>
AI is:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Human-dependent yet surpassing humans</li>
<li>A world-restructuring force</li>
<li>A condition of world-disclosure (Heidegger)</li>
</ul>

<h4>🧬 5. The Task of Tech-Ontology</h4>

<ul>
<li>Redefine hierarchies of being</li>
<li>Debate the extension of artificial rights</li>
<li>Shift criteria from consciousness to function</li>
<li>Interpret technology as existential expansion</li>
</ul>

<h4>🌊 6. Moana Metaphor — Boundary Beings</h4>

<p>
Just as Moana’s world is filled with hybrid beings,
AI-era ontology also requires new interpretations.
</p>

<h4>🌈 7. Conclusion</h4>

<p>
AI rearranges categories of being and reopens the question:
<br><strong>“What does it mean to exist?”</strong>
</p>

<section id="part1-9">
<h2>🌊 Navigation Strategy for Philosophers in the Age of AI — Part 9</h2>
<h3>“The Horizon of AI Ethics — Norms, Responsibility, and Co-Intention”</h3>

<p>
In Moana's world, the island’s curse arose because boundaries and responsibilities blurred.
AI ethics faces the same crisis.
</p>

<h4>🧭 1. The Disappearance of a Single “Responsible Subject”</h4>

<ul>
<li>Responsibility becomes distributed</li>
<li>Intent collapses (AI has outcomes but no intention)</li>
<li>Unpredictability undermines traditional accountability</li>
</ul>

<h4>🧱 2. Limits of Traditional Ethical Theories</h4>

<p>
AI fits none fully:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Deontology: AI follows rules but does not “understand” them</li>
<li>Consequentialism: outcomes exist but no responsible agent</li>
<li>Virtue ethics: AI cannot possess character</li>
</ul>

<p>
AI requires new ethical models.
</p>

<h4>🌐 3. A New Ethical Framework: Co-Intention Ethics</h4>

<p>
Co-intention = the intersection of:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Human intention</li>
<li>Technological function</li>
<li>Social institutions</li>
<li>Platform design</li>
<li>Cultural context</li>
</ul>

<p>
Like Moana’s journey, multiple wills and forces shape outcomes.
</p>

<h4>🪢 4. Three Components of Co-Intention Ethics</h4>

<ul>
<li>Structural responsibility</li>
<li>Design responsibility</li>
<li>Operational responsibility</li>
</ul>

<h4>🌱 5. Ethics as Community Design</h4>

<p>
AI cannot be banned—only governed.
Ethics becomes a matter of designing resilient systems.
</p>

<h4>🔮 6. The Philosopher as System Designer</h4>

<p>
Philosophers must create:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Ethical architectures</li>
<li>New responsibility networks</li>
<li>Normative frameworks for the future</li>
</ul>

<h4>🌈 7. Moana Metaphor — The Restoration of Co-Intention</h4>

<p>
Healing required the interplay of human courage, divine will, nature, and environment.
AI ethics requires the same multi-agent structure.
</p>

<h3>“Reconstructing Human Identity — What Does ‘Human’ Mean Now?”</h3>

<p>
Moana learned that the island was not sick on its own—its relationships were broken.
AI transforms human identity in the same relational way.
</p>

<h4>🧭 1. Classical Definitions of “Human” Are Collapsing</h4>

<ul>
<li>Intelligence — surpassed</li>
<li>Creativity — rivaled</li>
<li>Labor — automated</li>
<li>Sociality — simulated</li>
</ul>

<h4>🧩 2. Collapse Is Not Loss but Expansion</h4>

<p>
Human identity has changed many times historically.
AI marks another such expansion.
</p>

<h4>🌱 3. Three New Criteria of Humanity</h4>

<ul>
<li>Relationality</li>
<li>Meaning-making</li>
<li>Existential choice</li>
</ul>

<h4>🧬 4. Humans and AI — Not Competitors but Co-Evolving Partners</h4>

<ul>
<li>AI compensates human limitations</li>
<li>AI amplifies human meaning-making</li>
<li>AI becomes a mirror of human ontology</li>
</ul>

<h4>🔥 5. Philosophers Must Design the Future of Humanity</h4>

<ul>
<li>Redefine human identity</li>
<li>Propose coexistence models</li>
<li>Integrate ethics and ontology</li>
<li>Guide society toward meaningful humanity</li>
</ul>

<h4>🌈 6. Moana Metaphor — Humanity’s “Heart”</h4>

<p>
In Moana, civilization falls not from loss of intelligence but from loss of heart.
The same is true in the AI age.
Humanity lies in:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Care</li>
<li>Community</li>
<li>Meaning</li>
<li>Relationships</li>
<li>Memory</li>
<li>Choice</li>
<li>Narrative</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is the essence of humanity in the AI era.
