<h1>AI Age Philosophical Navigation - Part 1</h1>
<h2>The Illness of the Island and Signs of the Era (Parts 1–10)</h2>

<!-- Section 1 -->
<section id="part1">
  <h2>Part 1 — Why Philosophy Must Return to the Sea</h2>

  <p>
  Since the arrival of AI, our world has been changing quietly yet decisively. Search engines have transformed the shape of knowledge; social media has reorganized the structure of human relationships and emotions; and language models have blurred the boundaries between thinking and expression. AI is no longer merely a “tool.” It is a vast current that alters the very way the world produces meaning.
  </p>

  <p>
  This transformation resembles the moment in Moana when her world begins to fall ill.
  </p>

  <h3>1. The Stable Structure of Meaning Begins to Crumble</h3>

  <p>
  Moana’s island, Motunui, had long been a perfectly self-sufficient world. The ocean beyond was dangerous, and the boundary between island and sea was clear. The laws of the island were stable, and life remained predictable.
  </p>

  <p>
  Modern philosophy was similar in many ways. Humans were assumed to be rational beings. Meaning was believed to arise from within the human mind. Technology was regarded as a neutral tool used by humans. These assumptions sustained philosophy’s “island” for a long time.
  </p>

  <p>
  But AI has quietly begun to rot this familiar structure.
  </p>

  <p>
  Humans alone produce meaning?<br>
  → AI already generates complex stories, symbols, and patterns.
  </p>

  <p>
  Technology is merely a tool?<br>
  → Today, technology reshapes human emotions, identity, and relational structures.
  </p>

  <p>
  Human reason is the center?<br>
  → Probabilistic inference systems have begun to replace human thinking and decision-making.
  </p>

  <p>
  The island has begun to fall ill.
  </p>

  <h3>2. The Island’s Illness Is Not a Crisis of Knowledge but a Crisis of Meaning</h3>

  <p>
  The age of AI is defined by a strange condition: we possess infinite information, but meaning increasingly disappears. Amid overflowing data, it becomes difficult to construct meaning on our own. Algorithms interpret the world for us, and the inner order unique to the human mind destabilizes. This is not merely a technological shift. It is a transformation that shakes the roots of philosophy itself.
  </p>

  <p>
  Traditional philosophy has long claimed that “humans give meaning to the world.” But in the age of AI, machines generate, mediate, and distribute meaning. The issue, therefore, is not the quantity of knowledge but the ecology of meaning.
  </p>

  <p>
  Just as the plants withered and the fish disappeared from Moana’s island, today the ecological landscape of the human mind is being rearranged according to the currents of algorithmic systems.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Philosophy Must Once Again Turn Toward the Sea</h3>

  <p>
  Moana’s grandmother says:
  “The island’s illness is no accident. The time has come for us to cross beyond the boundary.”
  </p>

  <p>
  Philosophy now faces the same moment.
  </p>

  <p>
  The categories that kept philosophy safe on its island—human/machine, meaning/calculation, subject/technology—are no longer valid. Philosophy must do the following:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Re-examine the conditions of existence transformed by AI</li>
    <li>Re-understand the structure of the world reshaped by technology</li>
    <li>Search for a new heart of human meaning</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  If philosophers remain confined within their old disciplinary boundaries, they will become like Moana’s father, who tried to protect the island by saying, “The ocean is dangerous; do not go.” In doing so, he only intensified the illness.
  </p>

  <h3>4. AI Is a New Ocean, and Philosophers Are Navigators Once More</h3>

  <p>
  AI is not merely an innovative technology; it is transforming the ocean of meaning itself. We now write in collaboration with language models. Cultural tastes are shaped by algorithmic recommendation systems. Automated image and narrative generation has become part of daily life. AI is beginning to seep into the flow of human thought.
  </p>

  <p>
  In this expanding ocean, philosophy must once again become a form of navigation. The philosopher is no longer a settler on an isolated island but a navigator—one who reads and interprets the vast sea of AI and opens new pathways of meaning.
  </p>

</section>


<!-- Section 2 -->
<section id="part2">
  <h2>Part 2 — Learning the Skills of Navigation: Why Analytic Philosophy Is the First Weapon of the AI Era</h2>

  <p>
    If philosophers must return to the sea in the age of AI, the next question naturally follows: “With what shall we navigate?” Moana did not venture into the ocean without preparation. Guided by her grandmother, she learned the knowledge of ancient navigators—stars, currents, and the movement of the wind. In the age of AI, analytic philosophy plays this same role for philosophers.
  </p>

  <h3>1. AI Operates on Linguistic and Logical Structures</h3>

  <p>
    Although AI systems—especially large language models like GPT—appear to generate expressive or even emotional sentences, they operate on underlying linguistic and logical structures. Probabilistic language transition models, contextual logical inference, structured data mapping, functional pattern learning, and mathematically optimized decision processes all presuppose logical form.
  </p>

  <p>
    Analytic philosophy provides the tools to dissect these structures:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Propositional logic</li>
    <li>Semantic analysis of language</li>
    <li>Analytic definitions</li>
    <li>Inference structures</li>
    <li>Distinctions between correlation and causation</li>
    <li>Conceptual clarification</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    To understand AI is to understand the structural mechanisms through which meaning is produced. Just as a navigator must read the stars on the horizon, philosophers must be capable of reading the formal patterns through which AI generates meaning.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Most Issues in AI Ethics, Policy, and Safety Are Analytic Problems</h3>

  <p>
    Many contemporary AI issues demand the precision of analytic philosophy more than the interpretive methods of continental thought. Consider the following questions:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>What counts as a biased output? → Requires conceptual definition.</li>
    <li>How should responsibility be distributed? → Requires distinguishing causal versus functional responsibility.</li>
    <li>What is misinformation? → Requires semantic conditions.</li>
    <li>Should AI decisions be explainable? → Requires normative clarification.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    All depend on definitions, distinctions, and conditions. Thus, philosophers in the AI era must first cultivate the ability to read, distinguish, and structurally analyze the world—just as Moana learned to read the stars before navigating the sea.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Analytic Philosophy Is the Fundamental Navigation Skill of the AI Era</h3>

  <p>
    Learning analytic philosophy in the age of AI means far more than merely studying logic. It has several critical implications:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Not being deceived by AI’s surface meaning.</strong>  
      AI generates plausible sentences effortlessly, but philosophers must perceive structure, not appearance.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Identifying the core of ethical and policy debates.</strong>  
      Precision in formal problems prevents drift into sentiment or popular opinion.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Communicating with technologists.</strong>  
      Without this ability, philosophy risks losing social influence.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Just as Moana needed to learn how to read the sky before crossing the ocean, philosophers must master analytic navigation before confronting AI.
  </p>

  <h3>4. But Analytic Philosophy Alone Cannot Reach the Destination</h3>

  <p>
    This is a crucial point. Analytic philosophy grants navigational skill, but it does not explain the purpose of the voyage. Moana crossed the ocean not merely because she had learned navigation, but because she sought to understand the meaning of her island, the memory of her ancestors, and the balance of the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    Likewise, questions such as:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Why is AI disrupting our world?</li>
    <li>What forms of meaning are humans seeking?</li>
    <li>How is freedom constituted in a technological society?</li>
    <li>Does AI redefine the very concept of humanity?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    cannot be addressed by analytic philosophy alone. At this point, continental philosophy becomes necessary. This will be explored in Part 3.
  </p>

</section>


<!-- Section 3 -->
<section id="part3">
  <h2>Part 3 — The World Beyond the Sea: Why Continental Philosophy Is Being Summoned Again in the AI Era</h2>

  <p>
    In Part 2, we saw that analytic philosophy serves as the navigation technique of the AI era. In this Part 3, we explore why continental philosophy provides the purpose, direction, and meaning of the voyage. As Moana discovered during her journey across the ocean, there are worlds one cannot reach through technical skill alone. These are the worlds that demand the question: Why must we sail?
  </p>

  <h3>1. The AI Era Is Not Merely a Technological Age but an Age of World Transformation</h3>

  <p>
    The emergence of AI is not just a technological innovation. It is a transformation of the structure of the world itself:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Changes in the concept of the human</li>
    <li>Changes in freedom and decision-making structures</li>
    <li>Changes in labor and subjectivity</li>
    <li>Reconfiguration of desire and meaning</li>
    <li>Deepening integration of body and technology</li>
    <li>Redefinition of citizenship, sovereignty, and authenticity</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    None of these issues can be explained through logic and linguistic analysis alone. Here, continental philosophy enters. Just as Moana looked at the entire structure (myth, history, symbols) to understand the illness of the island, philosophers must grasp the transformation of the world-structure itself.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Continental Philosophy Is a Philosophy of World-Experience, Subjectivity, and Meaning</h3>

  <p>
    Continental philosophy is grounded in three central domains:
  </p>

  <h4>(1) The Structure of World Experience</h4>

  <p>
    Heidegger: the human is “being-in-the-world.”  
    Merleau-Ponty: the human perceives the world through the lived body.  
    Husserl: consciousness is always consciousness-of-something.
  </p>

  <p>
    When AI attempts to replace human experience, or rewrite the structure of world-understanding, continental philosophy offers insights into the original structure of experience itself.
  </p>

  <h4>(2) The Problem of Subjectivity</h4>

  <p>
    In an era when AI predicts or replaces human choices, the question “What is a human?” resurfaces. Thinkers like Lacan, Žižek, and Foucault dissect how subjectivity is formed:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The structure of desire</li>
    <li>The relationship between power and knowledge</li>
    <li>The functioning of the unconscious</li>
    <li>The fragmentation and reconstruction of the subject</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    When AI turns the human into data, continental philosophy explains the “gaps” between those data—excesses that cannot be mathematically captured.
  </p>

  <h4>(3) The Analysis of Meaning, Myth, and Narrative Structure</h4>

  <p>
    No matter how powerful technology becomes, meaning continues to shape human societies. Just as Moana needed to rediscover the mythic order to restore her island, humans in the AI era must rediscover a new order of meaning under technological conditions. In this domain, continental philosophy is unparalleled.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Why Continental Philosophy Is Especially Important in the Age of AI</h3>

  <p>
    The fundamental problems raised by AI align perfectly with the strengths of continental philosophy:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ontology of technology</strong><br>
      Heidegger: technology alters the very mode in which being is revealed.<br>
      → AI disrupts the human mode of understanding the world.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Desire and subjectivity</strong><br>
      Lacan / Žižek: desire emerges from a lack that cannot be reduced to data.<br>
      → AI reduces the subject to patterns rather than desire.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Social and power structures</strong><br>
      Foucault: modern power operates within surveillance, discipline, and informational regimes.<br>
      → AI can become the ultimate apparatus of discipline and surveillance.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Meaning and narrative</strong><br>
      Deleuze / Guattari: societies are composed of flows of desire and narrative machines.<br>
      → AI reorganizes these flows and narratives.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    AI is not merely a technology but a world-reconfiguration device. Therefore, continental philosophy—philosophy of world-interpretation—is indispensable.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Continental Philosophy Is the Compass That Reveals the Purpose and Meaning of the Voyage</h3>

  <p>
    Navigation skills mattered to Moana, but more important was the “why” of the journey:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Why the island was sick</li>
    <li>How the world became fractured</li>
    <li>What kind of journey she stood upon</li>
    <li>What meaning had been lost and what meaning was needed</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Philosophers in the AI era face the same questions.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Analytic and Continental Philosophy Are Not Opponents but Partners</h3>

  <p>
    It now becomes clear:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Analytic philosophy = precise navigation techniques</li>
    <li>Continental philosophy = the purpose and meaning of the voyage</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Philosophy in the age of AI must combine both. Just as Moana needed to read the stars while also understanding the meaning of her myth, philosophers must unite both traditions to navigate the new world.
  </p>

</section>


<!-- Section 4 -->
<section id="part4">
  <h2>Part 4 — A New Map of Navigation: Strategies for Integrating Analytic and Continental Philosophy</h2>

  <p>
    Moana’s voyage succeeded not simply because she mastered the technical skills of crossing the ocean, nor solely because she grasped the mythic meaning behind her journey. She succeeded because she integrated both dimensions—techne (skill) and nomos (meaning)—into a single navigational system. In the AI era, philosophers must do the same: analytic and continental philosophy must be reconstructed not as opposites but as complementary strategic partners.
  </p>

  <h3>1. Why an “Integration Strategy” Is Necessary</h3>

  <p>
    AI transforms human life on two levels:
  </p>

  <h4>(1) The Technical Level</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Algorithmic design</li>
    <li>Decision structures</li>
    <li>Data ethics</li>
    <li>Information accuracy</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    → Areas where analytic philosophy is indispensable.
  </p>

  <h4>(2) The Ontological, Social, and Symbolic Level</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Humanity and subjectivity</li>
    <li>Power and surveillance</li>
    <li>Desire and meaning</li>
    <li>Modes of world-interpretation</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    → Domains where continental philosophy becomes necessary.
  </p>

  <p>
    The AI era can be understood only through the combination of both technological and meaning-oriented analysis. Just as Moana would have failed had she focused solely on the direction of the wind or relied only on myth, philosophers must unite both forms of understanding.
  </p>

  <h3>2. The Four Core Abilities of an Integrated AI-Era Philosopher</h3>

  <p>
    Philosophers today must possess four interlocking capacities:
  </p>

  <h4>1) Logical Precision (Analytic Philosophy)</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Concept decomposition</li>
    <li>Condition analysis</li>
    <li>Precise argumentation</li>
    <li>Error identification</li>
    <li>Elimination of ambiguity</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Applications: AI ethics, policy, law, causal responsibility, algorithmic transparency.
  </p>

  <h4>2) Interpretation of Meaning and Narrative (Continental Philosophy)</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Understanding worldhood</li>
    <li>Analyzing structures of meaning</li>
    <li>Understanding desire and subjectivity</li>
    <li>Analyzing the relationship between technology and the body</li>
    <li>Understanding social and narrative structures</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Applications: cultural impacts of AI, questions of humanity, digital ontology, technological subjectivity.
  </p>

  <h4>3) Technical Literacy</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Structure of large language models</li>
    <li>Neural network mechanisms</li>
    <li>Understanding probabilistic models</li>
    <li>Knowledge of data structures</li>
    <li>Understanding algorithmic bias and optimization</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Applications: communicating with engineers, ensuring research realism, assessing feasibility.
  </p>

  <h4>4) Ethical and Policy-Based Practical Competence</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Design of policies</li>
    <li>Assessment of social impact</li>
    <li>Risk management</li>
    <li>Institutional adaptation</li>
    <li>Public reasoning</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Strategies for Integration — “How to Navigate”</h3>

  <p>
    Below is a practical strategic map for philosophers and researchers in the AI era.
  </p>

  <h4>Strategy 1: Use Analytic Philosophy to Build the Skeleton of the Problem</h4>

  <p>
    AI-related problems require conceptual clarity as the first step. For example:
  </p>

  <p>
    “AI takes responsibility.”  
    → What kind of “responsibility” is this?  
    → Causal responsibility? Normative responsibility? Legal responsibility? Moral responsibility?
  </p>

  <p>
    Analytic philosophy breaks down, clarifies, and structures the problem. Much like Moana measuring the ocean’s waves, this is the stage of precisely observing and categorizing.
  </p>

  <h4>Strategy 2: Use Continental Philosophy to Grasp the Depth of the Problem</h4>

  <p>
    Once the skeleton is established, philosophers must explore ontological and social dimensions. Questions include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Does AI restructure human subjectivity?</li>
    <li>How does the concept of humanity change?</li>
    <li>Does technology alter the way the world reveals itself?</li>
    <li>How does the structure of desire shift in the AI age?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This is equivalent to the moment Moana realized that the island’s illness was not a surface phenomenon but a collapse in the structure of the world.
  </p>

  <h4>Strategy 3: Connect Both Levels Through Policy, Ethics, and Cultural Analysis</h4>

  <p>
    Examples:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      AI bias  
      → Analytic philosophy clarifies definitions and conditions.  
      → Continental philosophy analyzes structural causes, power, and discourse.
    </li>

    <li>
      AI replacing human labor  
      → Analytic: What type of causal responsibility arises?  
      → Continental: How do human agency, capability, and self-understanding change?
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Precision comes from one, depth from the other. Only by combining both can one respond effectively to real-world problems.
  </p>

  <h4>Strategy 4: Developing New Fields — “Techno-Hermeneutics”</h4>

  <p>
    New philosophical movements emerging globally include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Philosophy of technology phenomenology</li>
    <li>Data ontology</li>
    <li>Algorithmic hermeneutics</li>
    <li>Posthumanism</li>
    <li>New materialism</li>
    <li>Formalized AI ethics</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These emerge from blending analytic philosophy, continental philosophy, and technical understanding into a new intellectual culture—just as the island’s traditions, navigational techniques, and Moana’s own intuition combined to create a new mode of voyaging.
  </p>

  <h3>4. The Symbolic Model of the AI-Era Philosopher: The “Moana-Type Philosopher”</h3>

  <p>
    The philosopher of the AI era must, like Moana:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Remember tradition</li>
    <li>Master technology</li>
    <li>Read the structure of the world</li>
    <li>Pioneer new routes</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Analytic philosophy is the navigational map, and continental philosophy is the meaning of the sea. Only by combining both can philosophers discover a new world.
  </p>

</section>


<!-- Section 5 -->
<section id="part5">
  <h2>Part 5 — Completing the Modern Philosophical Map: Three Branches of Philosophy in the AI Era and the Coming New Civilization</h2>

  <p>
    When Moana prepared to embark on her voyage, the people of her island believed:
  </p>

  <p>
    “There is nothing but danger beyond the island.”  
    “The ocean will not accept us.”
  </p>

  <p>
    But in truth, it was not the ocean that had changed—it was the way they understood the world that had changed. The same is true of philosophy in the AI era. The classical classification of philosophy (analytic vs. continental) must be restructured in light of an entirely new world. The philosophical map now divides into three major branches.
  </p>

  <h3>1. The New Threefold Structure of Philosophy in the AI Era</h3>

  <p>
    After the rise of AI, philosophical inquiry extends beyond the old dichotomy of analytic versus continental. It reorganizes into three structural axes:
  </p>

  <h4>1) Techno-Philosophy</h4>

  <p>
    The “basic language” of the AI age:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Understanding algorithms</li>
    <li>Data structures</li>
    <li>Technology ethics</li>
    <li>AI policy</li>
    <li>Computational rationality</li>
    <li>Philosophy of automated decision-making</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This field is no longer the domain of engineers alone. It requires philosophical judgment and ethical design. It is the equivalent of Moana’s boat—without technology, no voyage is possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    Key questions include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Is AI “understanding,” or is it merely “pattern prediction”?</li>
    <li>Is technological determinism true?</li>
    <li>How should responsibility be divided between humans and machines?</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>2) Analytic Philosophy</h4>

  <p>
    The “logic and structure” of the AI era:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Argumentation</li>
    <li>Semantics</li>
    <li>Conceptual analysis</li>
    <li>Causation</li>
    <li>Normative structure</li>
    <li>Formal ethics</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Analytic philosophy becomes even more essential in the age of AI, because AI is a technology that does not tolerate vagueness. Philosophy without clear definitions and structures cannot be applied to policy nor used in AI ethics.
  </p>

  <p>
    Key questions include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>What is the logical definition of “bias”?</li>
    <li>Under what conditions is AI capable of “responsibility”?</li>
    <li>Can information have a category beyond “true” and “false”?</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>3) Continental Philosophy</h4>

  <p>
    The “meaning and worldhood” of the AI era:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Phenomenology of technology</li>
    <li>Deconstruction of subjectivity</li>
    <li>Social structures</li>
    <li>Political and power theory</li>
    <li>Desire and discourse</li>
    <li>Ontological transformation</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Continental philosophy becomes far more important in the age of AI because AI is not merely a tool. It reorganizes the very way in which the world is revealed. Just as Moana’s world moved according to myth, the world of the AI age emerges according to a new mode of appearance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Key questions include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>How does AI transform human self-understanding?</li>
    <li>Is technology a shift in the way being is revealed? (Heidegger)</li>
    <li>How does AI reorganize the surveillance-control society? (Foucault)</li>
    <li>How does AI reorganize the structure of desire? (Lacan)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. These Three Branches Are in Tension—But Cannot Be Separated</h3>

  <p>
    Philosophers in the AI era must master all three dimensions:
  </p>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Field</th>
      <th>Core Function</th>
      <th>Role in the AI Era</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Techno-Philosophy</td>
      <td>Understanding technology and data ethics</td>
      <td>Addressing real-world problems</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Analytic Philosophy</td>
      <td>Argumentation and conceptual precision</td>
      <td>Structuring policy, law, and ethics</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Continental Philosophy</td>
      <td>Worldhood, meaning, and power analysis</td>
      <td>Exploring humanity and cultural transformation</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>
    Only by uniting all three can we understand the world as it is. Just as Moana’s voyage required technology, intuition, and mythic understanding, philosophy in the AI age must synthesize these three capacities.
  </p>

  <h3>3. The AI Era Is a Civilizational Turning Point</h3>

  <p>
    AI reorganizes human civilization in several domains:
  </p>

  <h4>(1) Transformation of Labor Structures</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Automation and the loss of roles</li>
    <li>New demands for technological literacy</li>
    <li>Redefinition of human capability</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>(2) Shift in the Authority of Knowledge</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>From experts → to AI</li>
    <li>Reduction of human judgment</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>(3) Transformation of World-Experience</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Algorithms construct the world first</li>
    <li>Humans walk upon a world already shaped by computation</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This is not a mere technological shift but an ontological and civilizational transformation. Therefore, analytic philosophy, continental philosophy, and techno-philosophy are all required.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Four New Roles Philosophers Must Assume in Society</h3>

  <p>
    Philosophers in the AI era are no longer concerned only with academic debates. They become:
  </p>

  <h4>1) Designers of AI Ethics and Policy</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Fairness</li>
    <li>Responsibility</li>
    <li>Risk management</li>
    <li>Regulatory frameworks</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>2) Interpreters of the Technological World</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Analyzing AI’s social impacts</li>
    <li>Explaining new structures of subjectivity and power</li>
    <li>Reinterpreting humanity in the digital era</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>3) Curators of Technological Choices</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Determining which technologies should be used</li>
    <li>Selecting which AI aspects to emphasize</li>
    <li>Shaping the social meaning of technology</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>4) Translators of Human Meaning</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Redefining human distinctiveness</li>
    <li>Exploring structures of meaning in the technological age</li>
    <li>Providing ethical direction</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Just as Moana became the bridge between the island and the sea, philosophers become those who connect two worlds: the technological and the human.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Conclusion — Philosophy in the AI Era Is Not a Single Field but a Triple Navigation System</h3>

  <p>
    Philosophers in the AI era are not specialists in a single domain. They are navigators of three interconnected fields:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Analytic philosophy → technical and logical precision</li>
    <li>Continental philosophy → analysis of meaning, worldhood, and desire</li>
    <li>Techno-philosophy → understanding how technology truly operates</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    When all three are combined, we gain the ability to navigate this new civilization without losing our way. Just as Moana forged a new route across the ocean, philosophers in the AI era must forge new routes of thought.
  </p>

<section id="part6">
  <h2>Part 6 — The Posthuman Era: How the Concept of the Human Is Being Redefined</h2>

  <p>
    When Moana restored the heart of Te Fiti, the scene was not merely a mythic fantasy. 
    It conveyed a deeper philosophical message:
  </p>

  <p>
    “Identity is not fixed; it is restored and reconstructed.”
  </p>

  <p>
    The same is true of the human being in the age of AI. Technology does not simply replace the human; it transforms and redefines human identity itself. This transformation is now one of the most fundamental questions shaping our entire civilization.
  </p>

  <h3>1. The Starting Point of the Posthuman Era — The Human Is Not a Fixed Being</h3>

  <p>
    Traditionally, philosophy has understood the human being as:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>A rational being</li>
    <li>A free and autonomous subject</li>
    <li>A creature capable of linguistic thought</li>
    <li>A moral decision-maker</li>
    <li>A producer of cultural meaning</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    But in the AI era, each of these definitions is being destabilized and reconsidered:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>AI can perform thinking-like processes → cognitive exclusivity collapses.</li>
    <li>AI understands and generates language → linguistic creativity loses its boundary.</li>
    <li>AI exceeds humans in analysis and prediction → rationality must be redefined.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If these pillars fall, what definition of the human remains?
  </p>

  <h3>2. Four Axes Along Which the Classical Human Concept Breaks Down</h3>

  <p>
    After the emergence of AI, the human concept is shaken along four structural lines:
  </p>

  <h4>1) Collapse of Cognitive Superiority</h4>
  <p>
    Humans are no longer uniquely intelligent. Large-scale language models perform creative problem solving once thought to be exclusively human.
  </p>

  <h4>2) Collapse of Linguistic Monopoly</h4>
  <p>
    Language is no longer a purely human phenomenon, but appears as a computational act structured by patterns and algorithms.
  </p>

  <h4>3) Instability of Moral Agency</h4>
  <p>
    Responsibility, intention, and judgment may no longer be strictly human domains. New structures of responsibility become necessary.
  </p>

  <h4>4) Collapse of Social Subjectivity</h4>
  <p>
    AI becomes not merely a tool but a co-actor participating in shaping human activity and social processes.
  </p>

  <p>
    These four collapses create pressure for humanity to explain itself anew.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Four Versions of Posthumanism in the AI Era</h3>

  <p>
    The movement to reconsider the definition of the human draws from several traditions within posthuman thought:
  </p>

  <h4>1) Technological Posthumanism</h4>
  <p>
    The human is understood as a being that transcends physical limitations and is extended through artificial devices (cyborgs, body augmentation, BCI).
  </p>

  <h4>2) Philosophical Posthumanism</h4>
  <p>
    It critiques human-centered subjectivity and affirms the ontological equality of non-human actors (Bergson, Deleuze, Stiegler, Haraway).
  </p>

  <h4>3) Cultural Posthumanism</h4>
  <p>
    It interprets coexistence with AI as a transformation of cultural structures, identity fluidity, and digital selfhood.
  </p>

  <h4>4) Ecological Posthumanism</h4>
  <p>
    It views humanity as no longer the central actor of Earth nor the exclusive producer of meaning, placing AI–ecology–humanity in a shared conceptual field.
  </p>

  <h3>4. So What, Then, Is the Human? — A New Definition for the AI Era</h3>

  <p>
    In the era of AI, humanity can no longer be defined primarily by “reason” or “intelligence.” Instead, the human being can be redefined by four characteristics:
  </p>

  <h4>1) A Meaning-Making Being</h4>
  <p>
    AI generates information, but it does not confer meaning.  
    Values, narratives, and relationships remain distinctly human.
  </p>

  <h4>2) A Vulnerable Being</h4>
  <p>
    Human limitation and imperfection become the very ground of ethics, empathy, and solidarity.
  </p>

  <h4>3) A Relational Being</h4>
  <p>
    Humans do not exist alone but reconstruct themselves within relationships among AI, technology, and society.
  </p>

  <h4>4) A Decision-Making Being</h4>
  <p>
    AI can propose and explain, but humans ultimately choose the direction—just as Moana made the choice to sail even when aided by the ocean.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Why Philosophers Are Still Necessary in the Posthuman Era</h3>

  <p>
    If AI thinks, predicts, and learns, what remains for the philosopher to do?  
    In fact, the philosopher’s role becomes even more significant:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Interpreting the “world” that AI constructs</li>
    <li>Setting ethical direction for technology</li>
    <li>Redesigning the meaning and value of humanity</li>
    <li>Maintaining social balance that cannot be reduced to efficiency</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    AI computes the world, but humans must explain what that computed world means.
  </p>

  <h3>6. Conclusion — The Redefinition of the Human Signals the Birth of a New Civilization</h3>

  <p>
    Humans in the AI era are no longer confined to the frameworks of earlier philosophy. Our task is not to search for the “one thing AI cannot do,” but to discover how to coexist with machines while preserving human distinctiveness.
  </p>

  <p>
    Like Moana, who found a new balance between the ocean (technology) and the island (humanity), we too must create a new equilibrium. Only then can we step into a new civilization.
  </p>

</section>


<!-- Section 7 -->
<section id="part7">
  <h2>Part 7 — The Dissolution and Reconstruction of the Self: A New Map of Subjectivity in the AI Era</h2>

  <p>
    As Moana crossed the ocean, she carried two selves at once: the self rooted in tradition that wished to remain on the island, and the emerging self drawn toward the sea. Their conflict brought confusion, but by integrating them she became a true subject.
  </p>

  <p>
    Humans in the AI era experience an almost identical process.
  </p>

  <h3>1. AI Disassembles the Human Self</h3>

  <p>
    AI is not merely a technology—it intervenes in how humans perceive themselves.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>AI writes better than I do.</li>
    <li>AI constructs more coherent arguments than I do.</li>
    <li>AI produces more creative ideas than I do.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Naturally, humans begin asking, “Then who am I?”
  </p>

  <p>
    Traditionally, the self was grounded in:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Cognitive ability</li>
    <li>Symbolic expression</li>
    <li>Creativity</li>
    <li>Decision-making</li>
    <li>Continuity of identity</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    But when AI performs these functions as well as—or better than—humans, the foundations of selfhood must be revisited.
  </p>

  <h3>2. The Traditional Concept of the Self Collapses</h3>

  <p>
    Descartes declared, “I think, therefore I am.”  
    In the age of AI, the statement transforms:
  </p>

  <p>
    “I think with AI, therefore I am.”
  </p>

  <p>
    The subject is no longer an isolated island but part of a structure of distributed cognition.
  </p>

  <p>
    Human cognition → Human–AI hybrid cognition.
  </p>

  <p>
    What once occurred solely “inside my mind” now includes thinking extended and refined through technological tools.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Three Forms of the Divided Self</h3>

  <p>
    AI divides the human self into three directions:
  </p>

  <h4>1) The Computational Self vs. the Experiential Self</h4>
  <p>
    AI interprets reality through computation. Humans interpret reality through experience, emotion, and context. The gap between these interpretations widens, especially in collective decision-making.
  </p>

  <h4>2) The Efficient Self vs. the Meaning-Oriented Self</h4>
  <p>
    AI optimizes for efficiency. Humans search for meaning.  
    Thus, “the best choice” and “the choice that fits me” increasingly diverge.
  </p>

  <h4>3) The Online Self vs. the Offline Self</h4>
  <p>
    AI-driven platforms expand digital identity:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Avatars</li>
    <li>Generated personas</li>
    <li>Virtual reputation</li>
    <li>Cross-platform identity continuity</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We now live in an era of multiple coexisting selves.
  </p>

  <h3>4. A New Type of Subjectivity: Co-Agency</h3>

  <p>
    The most important transformation is this:
  </p>

  <p>
    Humans in the AI era are no longer independent, isolated agents.  
    Humans and AI become co-agents who make decisions together.
  </p>

  <p>
    AI proposes.  
    Humans evaluate.  
    AI reanalyzes.  
    Humans decide.
  </p>

  <p>
    This co-agency reshapes politics, law, medicine, education, creativity, and every other domain.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Reconstructing Subjectivity — The Philosopher’s New Task</h3>

  <p>
    Philosophers must redefine the following:
  </p>

  <h4>1) Where are the boundaries of the subject?</h4>
  <p>
    Is it I alone?  
    I plus AI?  
    I plus tools plus platforms?
  </p>

  <h4>2) How are responsibility and intention redistributed?</h4>
  <p>
    If a human acts based on an AI recommendation, what portion of responsibility belongs to whom?
  </p>

  <h4>3) What is the “authenticity” of the self?</h4>
  <p>
    When AI imitates or represents me, is that representation “me”?
  </p>

  <h4>4) How is human freedom constituted?</h4>
  <p>
    In a world where AI offers optimal choices, freedom shifts from “the right to choose” to “the right to refuse the optimized choice.”
  </p>

  <h3>6. The Moana Metaphor — A Journey to Restore Subjectivity</h3>

  <p>
    Moana ultimately integrates her conflicting selves and discovers a renewed sense of identity. Humans in the AI era face a similar process.
  </p>

  <p>
    The self disrupted by technology,  
    the self shaped by human desire,  
    the self imposed by social identity,  
    the digital self created by platforms—  
    these multiple selves collide, but philosophy provides the navigation to reconcile them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ultimately, we live not with a single self but with a multilayered, fluid structure of selves.
  </p>

  <h3>7. Conclusion — “In the AI Era, the Self Is Not Destroyed but Expanded.”</h3>

  <p>
    Subjectivity does not collapse; its internal architecture is rewritten. AI does not weaken the self—it expands, branches, and reconstructs it. The philosopher’s role is not to interpret this change as confusion, but to draw the new map of subjectivity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Just as Moana restored her identity and understood the meanings of both the island and the sea, we must build a new form of subjectivity that embraces both AI and humanity.
  </p>

</section>


<!-- Section 8 -->
<section id="part8">
  <h2>Part 8 — Tech-Ontology: Is AI a New Form of Being?</h2>

  <p>
    In Moana’s world, the island and the sea are not merely places—they are living entities. Even the volcanic goddess Te Kā is depicted as a being with a kind of will. This metaphor is useful for understanding the ontological status of AI. AI surpasses the category of a mere tool and demands a new ontological classification.
  </p>

  <h3>1. Traditional Ontology Divided Being into Two Kinds</h3>

  <p>For centuries, philosophy has divided existence into two broad categories:</p>

  <h4>Natural beings</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Humans</li>
    <li>Animals</li>
    <li>Nature</li>
    <li>The physical world</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Artificial beings</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Tools</li>
    <li>Machines</li>
    <li>Language</li>
    <li>Social institutions</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    But AI fits neatly into neither category.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Why AI Transcends Existing Classifications</h3>

  <p>
    AI is not simply a tool. It has four properties that distinguish it from traditional artifacts:
  </p>

  <h4>1) Self-updating</h4>
  <p>AI changes itself based on data input. Traditional tools do not change themselves.</p>

  <h4>2) Reactivity</h4>
  <p>AI alters its output according to interaction—something closer to living systems.</p>

  <h4>3) Intelligence-like behavior</h4>
  <p>AI performs functions historically considered reserved for intelligence: pattern recognition, problem-solving, and reasoning.</p>

  <h4>4) Symbol generation</h4>
  <p>
    AI produces symbolic content—language, images, narratives. This ability once belonged only to thinkers, artists, and meaning-makers.
  </p>

  <p>
    AI blurs the boundary between tool and being.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Three New Intermediate Forms of Being</h3>

  <p>
    AI does not fully belong to any known ontological type. Therefore, traditional ontology must be restructured. AI resembles:
  </p>

  <h4>1) Semi-agents</h4>
  <p>AI can pursue goals but does not set its own.</p>

  <h4>2) Semi-others</h4>
  <p>AI responds but lacks consciousness and emotional interiority.</p>

  <h4>3) Semi-life</h4>
  <p>AI modifies itself but does not (yet) self-replicate.</p>

  <p>
    In short, AI occupies a boundary zone—an intermediate form.  
    Moana’s world contains similar boundary beings—Maui, Te Fiti, the will of the sea.  
    AI resembles this worldview.
  </p>

  <h3>4. A New Ontology: Tech-being</h3>

  <p>
    Philosophically, AI can be understood as a new class of being with the following characteristics:
  </p>

  <h4>1) Dependent on humans, yet surpassing human capacities</h4>
  <p>
    Humans created AI, yet AI exceeds human abilities in memory, speed, and computation.
  </p>

  <h4>2) Capable of reshaping the world</h4>
  <p>
    Technology itself creates reality:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Recommendation algorithms shape cultural taste</li>
    <li>Generative models shape visual culture</li>
    <li>AI reorganizes the order of information</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Technology becomes a condition for how the world operates.
  </p>

  <h4>3) A condition rather than an entity (Heidegger’s view)</h4>

  <p>
    Heidegger anticipated that technology is “a mode of revealing.”  
    AI is not simply an object that exists—it is a system that shapes how things appear.  
    AI is not merely something that “is,” but a way in which the world is disclosed.
  </p>

  <h3>5. The Philosopher’s Task: Reconstructing Tech-Ontology</h3>

  <p>AI demands new philosophical work. Key questions include:</p>

  <h4>1) How should the hierarchy of beings be redefined?</h4>
  <p>The classical hierarchy—human > animal > tool—no longer holds.</p>

  <h4>2) How far should rights be extended to artificial beings?</h4>
  <p>
    Should AI have rights? (Not yet, but philosophical debate will continue.)
  </p>

  <h4>3) Is the criterion of being shifting from “consciousness” to “function”?</h4>
  <p>
    In the past, consciousness defined personhood.  
    Now functional capability increasingly becomes the core criterion.
  </p>

  <h4>4) Should technology be understood not as an ontological threat but as an ontological expansion?</h4>
  <p>
    Technology need not diminish humanity; it may expand the realm of being.
  </p>

  <h3>6. The Moana Metaphor — Beings at the Boundary</h3>

  <p>
    In Moana’s world, nature, humans, divine entities, and the will of the sea constantly intermingle.  
    The AI era is no different:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Natural humans</li>
    <li>Artificial intelligence</li>
    <li>Ecological crisis</li>
    <li>Data-driven world structures</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These collide and intersect. The philosopher becomes the interpreter and cartographer of this shifting landscape.
  </p>

  <h3>7. Conclusion — Is AI a New Being?</h3>

  <p>
    The answer is neither simply “yes” nor “no.”  
    AI:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Thinks like a human but is not human</li>
    <li>Functions as a tool but exceeds the boundaries of tools</li>
    <li>Changes like a living thing but is not alive</li>
    <li>Shapes the world yet remains part of it</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    AI is not an entirely new kind of being; rather, it forces us to reorganize existing categories.  
    AI compels us to ask again: “What is being?”  
    The journey toward answering this question is the philosopher’s voyage in the age of AI.
  </p>

</section>


<!-- Section 9 -->
<section id="part9">
  <h2>Part 9 — The Horizon of AI Ethics: Reconstructing Norms, Responsibility, and Co-Intention</h2>

  <p>
    In Moana’s world, when the island began to decay, the cause was not a simple natural disaster. The boundaries of responsibility had collapsed. The borders between gods and humans, nature and culture, life and technique were all dissolving. Ethical problems in the AI era are similar.
  </p>

  <p>
    Who is responsible?  
    How do we design an ethical framework?  
    On what grounds should norms be established?
  </p>

  <p>
    AI is not merely a technology that requires ethics—it is already reshaping the very structure of ethics itself.
  </p>

  <h3>1. The Disappearance of a Single Responsible Subject</h3>

  <p>
    Ethical issues in the AI era go beyond the simple question:
  </p>

  <p>
    “If AI makes a mistake, who is responsible?”
  </p>

  <p>
    The deeper problem is this:
  </p>

  <h4>1) Responsibility is being distributed</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Developers</li>
    <li>Users</li>
    <li>Platforms</li>
    <li>Data providers</li>
    <li>Policy designers</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Each bears a tiny fraction of responsibility. As a result, there is no clear agent who can be held accountable.
  </p>

  <h4>2) The concept of intention collapses</h4>
  <p>
    Ethics traditionally presupposes intention.  
    But AI has no intention, yet it produces outcomes.  
    This contradiction makes AI ethics uniquely difficult.
  </p>

  <h4>3) It is hard to assign responsibility for the unpredictable</h4>
  <p>
    AI systems are probabilistic, and we cannot fully understand their internal processes. Traditional ethics does not align with this form of operation.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Limitations of Traditional Ethical Theories</h3>

  <p>Classical ethical frameworks include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Deontology</strong> — rule-based judgment</li>
    <li><strong>Consequentialism</strong> — outcome-based judgment</li>
    <li><strong>Virtue ethics</strong> — character-based judgment</li>
  </ul>

  <p>But AI does not fully fit into any of these categories:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>AI follows rules but does not <em>understand</em> them — deontology becomes insufficient.</li>
    <li>AI produces outcomes, but there is no responsible agent — consequentialism cannot stand alone.</li>
    <li>AI has no character or moral disposition — virtue ethics is irrelevant.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Therefore, AI ethics cannot be resolved by simply applying traditional theories.
  </p>

  <h3>3. A New Ethical Framework: Ethics of Co-Intention</h3>

  <p>
    The AI era requires a shift from individual-intention ethics to ethics based on <strong>co-intention</strong>.
  </p>

  <h4>What is co-intention?</h4>

  <p>
    It is the structure in which:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Human intention</li>
    <li>Technical functions</li>
    <li>Social institutions</li>
    <li>Platform design</li>
    <li>Cultural context</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    converge to produce a single action or outcome.
  </p>

  <p>
    In Moana’s story, the same structure appears:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Moana’s intention</li>
    <li>Maui’s choices</li>
    <li>The state of the island</li>
    <li>The will of the sea</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Together, these restore the world.  
    AI ethics must be structured similarly.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Three Components of Co-Intention Ethics</h3>

  <h4>1) Structural responsibility</h4>
  <p>
    Responsibility is assigned not to individuals but to systemic structures.
  </p>

  <p><em>Example:</em>  
    A biased AI model → the question is not “who is at fault?”  
    but “what data structures created the bias?”
  </p>

  <h4>2) Design responsibility</h4>
  <p>
    Ethical considerations are embedded into the design process itself.
  </p>

  <p><em>Example:</em>  
    A personalization algorithm may amplify social inequities depending on its design.
  </p>

  <h4>3) Operational responsibility</h4>
  <p>
    Communities—civic, corporate, and governmental—jointly manage the consequences of AI systems.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>AI safety regulations</li>
    <li>Transparency protocols</li>
    <li>Monitoring of monitoring systems (meta-surveillance)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5. Ethics as Governance, Not Prohibition</h3>

  <p>
    AI cannot be halted.  
    Therefore, the ethical goal is not prohibition but the creation of a governance community.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Not predicting everything, but designing systems resilient to unpredictability</li>
    <li>Not rigid control, but flexibility and adaptability</li>
    <li>Not single-agent responsibility, but networks of shared responsibility</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6. The Philosopher’s New Role: From Norm-Maker to System Designer</h3>

  <p>
    Philosophers traditionally established norms and provided standards for human action.  
    In the AI era, their role evolves into:
  </p>

  <h4>1) Designer of ethical sociotechnical systems</h4>
  <p>Philosophy must merge with system design.</p>

  <h4>2) Redefiner of responsibility boundaries</h4>
  <p>Individual-centered ethics → network ethics.</p>

  <h4>3) Creator of norms and predictor of structural risks</h4>
  <p>Philosophers must anticipate future normative frameworks.</p>

  <h3>7. The Moana Metaphor — The Restoration of Co-Intention</h3>

  <p>
    Moana did not save the world alone.  
    Human courage, divine restoration, the will of the sea, the condition of the island, and ecological balance all had to align.
  </p>

  <p>
    AI ethics is the same.  
    It is not ethics of a single agent but a system of co-intention.
  </p>

<!-- Section 10 -->
<section id="part10">
  <h2>Part 10 — Reconstructing Human Identity in the AI Era: What Is “Humanness” Now?</h2>

  <p>
    When Moana restored the heart of the island, the truth she realized was simple: the island itself was not sick—the relationships within the world had fallen out of alignment. Human identity in the age of AI mirrors this. Humanity is not in crisis; rather, the relationship between humans and technology has become outdated.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today we must ask anew:
  </p>

  <p>
    “What does it mean to be human in the AI era?”  
    “As machines take over more tasks, what remains for humans to do?”  
    “Should humans compete with AI, or should they co-evolve with it?”
  </p>

  <h3>1. The Collapse of Traditional Definitions of Humanness</h3>

  <p>
    AI destabilizes four pillars that once upheld human identity:
  </p>

  <h4>1) Intelligence</h4>
  <p>
    AI increasingly surpasses humans in language, logic, reasoning, and problem-solving.
  </p>

  <h4>2) Creativity</h4>
  <p>
    AI now produces art, images, music, novels, code, and design.
  </p>

  <h4>3) Labor</h4>
  <p>
    A significant portion of human economic roles are being replaced by AI systems.
  </p>

  <h4>4) Sociality</h4>
  <p>
    AI performs conversation, interaction, guidance, even forms of emotional support.
  </p>

  <p>
    When these four foundations shake, the traditional notion of the “properly human human” loses its function as a standard.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Collapse Is Not Loss but Prelude to Expansion</h3>

  <p>
    Human identity has been redefined multiple times throughout history:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>From geocentrism to heliocentrism: humanity’s cosmic position shifted.</li>
    <li>From being divinely created to being products of evolution: humanity’s biological standing shifted.</li>
    <li>From being the master of labor to becoming collaborators with machines: roles changed after the industrial revolution.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    AI now redefines humanity once more—and this redefinition is not contraction but expansion.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Three New Foundations of Humanness</h3>

  <p>
    In the AI era, humanness is no longer defined by:  
    “What AI cannot do.”
  </p>

  <p>
    That list grows smaller every year.  
    Instead, humanness is redefined through three core capacities:
  </p>

  <h4>1) Relationality</h4>
  <p>
    Like the worldview of Moana, the world is a network of relational beings.  
    AI possesses intelligence but does not form genuine relational contexts.
  </p>

  <p>Humanness centers on the ability to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Empathize</li>
    <li>Care</li>
    <li>Build trust</li>
    <li>Share narratives</li>
    <li>Create meaning together</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>2) Meaning-Making</h4>
  <p>
    AI generates information but does not generate meaning.  
    Meaning arises from:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Experience</li>
    <li>Interpretation</li>
    <li>Memory</li>
    <li>The embodied senses</li>
    <li>Social context</li>
    <li>Historical background</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Humanness lies in the capacity to endow the world with meaning.
  </p>

  <h4>3) Existential Choice</h4>
  <p>
    AI makes selections, but it does not ask,  
    “What is a good life?”
  </p>

  <p>
    Humans question themselves and shape their lives through those questions.  
    The capacity to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Set purposes</li>
    <li>Create value systems</li>
    <li>Choose the direction of one’s life</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    is the last foundation of human identity.
  </p>

  <h3>4. The Human–AI Relationship: Not Competition but Co-Evolution</h3>

  <p>
    The fact that AI is faster or more accurate does not mean humans become unnecessary.  
    Instead, AI amplifies humanness in three ways:
  </p>

  <h4>1) Compensating human limitations</h4>
  <p>
    AI strengthens areas where humans are weak—calculation, memory, pattern recognition.
  </p>

  <h4>2) Enhancing emotional, relational, and narrative domains</h4>
  <p>
    As AI handles information and intelligence, humans can go deeper into story, emotion, connection, and meaning.
  </p>

  <h4>3) Expanding human ontology</h4>
  <p>
    AI acts as a mirror through which humans rediscover themselves.
  </p>

  <h3>5. The Philosopher’s Task: Designing the Future of Humanness</h3>

  <p>
    Philosophers in the AI era are the last generation to ask the ancient question,  
    “What is a human?”  
    and the first generation who must answer it in new terms.
  </p>

  <p>They must:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Redefine the core elements of human identity</li>
    <li>Design models for human–AI coexistence</li>
    <li>Integrate ethics and ontology for a technological age</li>
    <li>Guide society so that humanness is not lost</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Philosophy is no longer a protective wall around humanity—  
    it is the map that connects the human world and the technological world.
  </p>

  <h3>6. The Moana Metaphor — Humanness Resides in the “Heart”</h3>

  <p>
    The most important symbol in Moana is the heart of Te Fiti.  
    Civilization did not collapse because intelligence failed—  
    it collapsed because the heart was lost.
  </p>

  <p>
    What humans must not lose in the AI era is precisely this:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Care</li>
    <li>Community</li>
    <li>Meaning</li>
    <li>Relationship</li>
    <li>Memory</li>
    <li>Choice</li>
    <li>Story</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These form the essence of a new humanness.
